# Install and set up tools for authoring in GitHub

Follow the steps in this article to set up tools for contributing to the System Center technical documentation.

If you're unfamiliar with Git, you might want to review some Git terminology: [https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary). In addition, this StackOverflow thread contains a glossary of Git terms you'll encounter in this set of steps: [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7076164/terminology-used-by-git](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7076164/terminology-used-by-git)

## Create a GitHub account and set up your profile

The sign up page is at [https://github.com/join](https://github.com/join). If you already have a personal Github account, you’ll want to set up a Microsoft-specific account.

You need to set up your GitHub account so you're clearly identified as a Microsoft employee. Set up your profile as follows:

- **Profile picture**: a picture of you (required)
- **Name**: your first and last name (required)
- **Email**: your Microsoft email address (optional)
- **Company**: Microsoft Corporation (required)
- **Location**: list your location (optional)

## Enable multifactor authentication for your Github Account
You have to enable two factor authentication (2FA) on your GitHub account since you are working in a private content repository.

To enable this, follow the instructions in both the following GitHub help topics:

- [About Two-Factor Authentication](https://help.github.com/articles/about-two-factor-authentication/)
- [Creating an access token for command-line use](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use/)

When you create the token, select all the scopes available in the token-creation UI. See [details on each scope](https://developer.github.com/v3/oauth/#scopes) for more information.

After you enable 2FA, you have to enter the access token instead of your GitHub password at the command prompt when you try to access a GitHub repository from the command line. The access token is not the authentication code that you get in a text message when you set up 2FA. It's a long string that looks something like this: fdd3b7d3d4f0d2bb2cd3d58dba54bd6bafcd8dee.

A few notes about this:

- When you create your access token, save it in a text file to make it readily accessible when you need it.
- Later, when you need to paste the token, know there are two ways to paste in the command line:
    - Click the icon in the upper left corner of the command line window>Edit>Paste.
    - Right-click the icon in the upper left corner of the window and click Properties>Options>QuickEdit Mode. This configures the command line so you can paste by right-clicking in the command line window.

## Link your GitHub account to your Microsoft identity

Go to [https://opensourcehub.microsoft.com/](https://opensourcehub.microsoft.com/)

If you see a page like this, it means your GitHub account and Microsoft alias are not yet linked.

![profile not linked](./media/tools-and-setup/image1.png)

### Link your account

1. Click either the red link icon next to your picture at the top of the page or **Link account**.

    ![link account](./media/tools-and-setup/image2.png)

2. Click **Link a GitHub account**.

    ![link a GitHub account](./media/tools-and-setup/image3.png)

3. Verify the steps on the next page.

4. Click **Authorize application** to authorize the Open Source Hub application in your GitHub account. After a short time, you should see the Congratulations page that looks like this.

    ![authorize application](./media/tools-and-setup/image4.png)

5. Accept the invitation to join the Microsoft GitHub Organization at [https://github.com/Microsoft](https://github.com/Microsoft). If you see a red "!" mark, just click the green link beside it to complete that task.

Now your alias is linked with your GitHub account and you have successfully joined the Microsoft GitHub organization. You will receive a notification email that your GitHub account has been linked with your Microsoft account.

Note that developers and teams have a responsibility to make sure any open source contribution is fully in line with [Microsoft's open source policies](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/sites/lcaweb/Home/Product-Development/Using-Open-Source-Software) and that you have worked with your LCA contact to make sure any contributions you are making are approved.

## Authorize the OPS build system to access your GitHub account

Do this by going to [https://op-portal-prod.azurewebsites.net/#/login](https://op-portal-prod.azurewebsites.net/#/login) and signing in with your GitHub credentials.

## Install and configure git tools

Install Git for Windows from [http://git-scm.com/download/win](http://git-scm.com/download/win). This download installs the Git version control system, and it installs Git Bash, the command-line app that you will use to interact with your local Git repository.

You can accept the default settings; if you want the commands to be available within the Windows command line, select the option that enables it.

 ![GitHub profile example](./media/tools-and-setup/gitbashinstall.png)

(Note: This is not the same as "Github for Windows". "Github for Windows" is a different GUI-based tool that will also work if you want to read up on yourself. [https://windows.github.com/](https://windows.github.com/))

## Install a markdown editor

We author content using simple "markdown" notation in the files, rather than complex "markup" (HTML, XML, etc.). So, you'll need to install a markdown editor.

- **Atom**: Most of us use GitHub's Atom markdown editor: [http://atom.io](http://atom.io). It does not require a license for business use. It has spell check.

- **Notepad**: You can use Notepad for a very lightweight option.

- **Prose**: This is a lightweight, elegant, on-line, and open source markdown editor that offers a preview. Visit [http://prose.io](http://prose.io) and authorize Prose in your repository.

- **[Visual Studio Code](https://www.visualstudio.com/products/code-vs.aspx)** - Microsoft's entry in this space.

## Configure Atom

If you use Atom, you'll need to set a few things up.

- Atom defaults to using 2 spaces for tabs, but Markdown expects 4 spaces. If you leave it at the default of two, your article will look great in local preview, but not when it’s imported into OPS. So, configure Atom to use 4 spaces - you can find this setting under File>Settings>Editor Settings>Tab Length.
- You will probably also want to turn on Soft Wrap in this section too, which does the same as "word wrap" in Notepad.
- To turn on the markdown preview, click Packages>Markdown Preview>Toggle Preview. You can use Ctrl-Shift-M to toggle the preview HTML view.

## Fork the repository and copy it to your computer

1. Create a fork of the repository in GitHub - go to the top-right of the page and click the Fork button. If prompted, select your account as the location where the fork should be created. This creates a copy of the repository within your Git Hub account. Generally speaking, technical writers and program managers need to fork systemcenterdocs-pr. You only need to fork one time; after your first setup, if you want to copy your fork to another computer, you only have to run the commands that follow in this section to copy the repo to your computer.  If you choose to create forks of both repositories, you will need to create a fork for each repository.

2. Copy the Personal Access Token that you got from [https://github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens). You can accept the default permissions for the token.  Save the Personal Access Token in a text file for later reuse.

3. Next, copy the repository to your computer with your credentials embedded in the command string.  To do this, open Git Bash and run it as an administrator. At the command prompt, enter the following command.  This command creates a systemcenterdocs-pr directory on your computer.  If you're using the default location, it will be at c:\users<your Windows user name>\SystemCenterDocs-pr.

        git clone https://[your GitHub user name]:[token]@github.com/<your GitHub user name>/systemcenterdocs-pr.git

For example, this clone command could look something like this:

        git clone https://smithj:b428654321d613773d423ef2f173ddf4a312345@github.com/smithj/systemcenterdocs-pr.git  

## Set remote repository connection and configure credentials

Create a reference to the root repository by entering these commands. This sets up connections to the repository in GitHub so that you can get the latest changes onto your local machine and push your changes back to GitHub. This command also configures your token locally so that you don't have to enter your name and password each time you try to access the upstream repo and your fork on GitHub.

        cd systemcenterdocs-pr
        git remote add upstream https://[your GitHub user name]:[token]@github.com/Microsoft/systemcenterdocs-pr.git
        git fetch upstream

This usually takes a while. After you do this, you won't have to fork again or enter your credentials again. You would only have to copy the forks to a local computer again if you set the tools up on another computer.

## Configure your user name and email locally

To ensure you are listed correctly as a contributor, you need to configure your user name and email locally in Git.

1. Start Git Bash, and switch into systemcenterdocs-pr:

   ````
   cd systemcenterdocs-pr
   ````

2. Configure your user name so it matches your name as you set it up in your GitHub profile:

    ````
    git config --global user.name "John Doe"
    ````
3. Configure your email so it matches the primary email designated in your GitHub profile; if you're a MSFT employee, it should be your MSFT email address:

    ````
    git config --global user.email "alias@example.com"
    ````
4. Type `git config -l` and review your local settings to ensure the user name and email in the configuration are correct.
