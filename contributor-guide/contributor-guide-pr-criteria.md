# Quality criteria for pull request review

These criteria are intended for authors who create and maintain technical articles and for pull request reviewers who review content pull requests. Pull request reviewers generally review only what is new or changed. Pull request reviewers evaluate the changes in a pull request according to the blocking and non-blocking quality review items listed in this article.

## Blocking content quality items

The updates in the pull request must comply with the following criteria to be merged. Pull request reviewers provide feedback in pull request comments for these items and type `#hold-off` in the pull request to return it to you (the author) with feedback.

| Category | Quality review item |
|----------|---------------------|
|Prerequisites|	The pull request cannot validation errors or warnings.|
|Prerequisites| The pull request cannot be blocked by a merge conflict.|
|Repo integrity|	Pull request contains no obvious content regressions.|
|Repo integrity|	Pull request does not include an embedded repo or any unusual, extraneous files.|
|Repo integrity	|Pull request contains fewer than 100 changed files unless the PR intentionally is updating a release branch from master. (Really, a PR should contain far fewer than that, but after 100 changed files, GitHub doesn’t display the diffs).|
|Repo integrity|	Pull request does not get merged by the person who created the pull request.|
|Naming	|File names for new files follow the [file naming guidelines](file-names-and-locations.md).|
|Naming	|New folders introduced into the repo follow the [folder naming guidelines](file-names-and-locations.md#folder-names-in-the-repo).|
|Content	|The article is a technical document, and therefore in the correct content channel. See the [what goes where guidance](https://github.com/Azure/azure-content-pr/blob/master/contributor-guide/content-channel-guidance.md).|
|Content	|The subject matter in the technical document is appropriate for a technical article. See the [what goes where guidance](https://github.com/Azure/azure-content-pr/blob/master/contributor-guide/content-channel-guidance.md).|
|Content	|The article contains an introductory paragraph, and a procedural or conceptual body of content. The article needs to contain sufficient, complete content to stand on its own as an article. It should not be a small fragment of information. (Exception: A "Limits" topic if it is in the context of a large article that lists all of the limits of a service.)|
|Content| Elements that should be numbered lists are numbered, elements that should be unordered lists are bulleted. This is basic usability.|
|Content| Unusual or novel graphics, information architecture or structures, or obviously non-standard designs need to be vetted with the lead PR reviewer. Teams that are experimenting with new things need to have a problem/solution canvas or plan in place for evaluating experiments.|
|Site/design functionality|	Manually authored TOCs are not permitted. The article must rely on H2s for its on-page TOC.|
|Site/design functionality|	If H2 headings are present, the article contains at least two H2 headings. Using one H2 heading creates a single-item article TOC. H2 headings must be used before H3 headings to ensure a TOC is created.|
|Markdown| HTML: Source content does not contain HTML at the block level – minor inline HTML is permitted – such as superscript, subscript, special characters, and other minor things that you can’t do with markdown. HTML tables are allowed ONLY if the table contains bulleted or numbered lists, but that is usually an indication the content needs to be simplified so the source can be coded in markdown.|
|Markdown	|Custom markdown elements are used where appropriate. Ex: Notes are coded using the !NOTE extension, not as plain text.|
|SEO	|The H1 title contains sufficient information to describe the content of the article, to differentiate it from other System Center articles, and to map to likely customer keywords. For example "Overview" as the H1 title is a fail.|
|Images	|Animated GIFs are not accepted into the repo.|
|Images | Images have clear resolution, are free of misspelled words, and contain no private information |
|Staging| The article preview must be clean on GitHub. It cannot contain any obvious formatting issues: <br><br>- A numbered or bulleted list that appears as a paragraph <br> - Code in a code block appearing partly in the code block and partly outside it <br>- Numbered steps numbered incorrectly due to faulty indentation|

## Non-blocking content quality items

For these items, pull request reviewers provide feedback and instructions for the author to follow up with fixes in a later pull request. However, this feedback does not block the decision to merge. Authors should follow up within 3 business days with fixes.

| Category | Quality review item |
|----------|---------------------|
|Content|Articles should have a “Next steps” at the end with 1-3 relevant and compelling next steps. Brief text should be included that helps the customer understand why the next steps are relevant. (New articles only).
|Images|Images use the correct callout style and color, and screenshots use the correct border and placeholder style. [See the image guidance](https://github.com/Azure/azure-content/blob/master/contributor-guide/create-images-markdown.md).|
|Images|Images include alt text. [See the image guidance](https://github.com/Azure/azure-content/blob/master/contributor-guide/create-images-markdown.md).|
|Site/design functionality|The H2 headings, when rendered in the on-page TOC, should ideally wrap to no more than 2 lines. Longer headings make the article TOC harder to scan.|
|Style conventions|All titles and headings are sentence case.|
|Process|When you delete or rename an article, make sure you follow the process. Pull request reviewers should add the following comment and link in a comment:<br><br>*Please verify you followed the process in the contributors’ guide for deleting articles: <https://github.com/Azure/azure-content/blob/master/contributor-guide/retire-or-rename-an-article.md> .*|
