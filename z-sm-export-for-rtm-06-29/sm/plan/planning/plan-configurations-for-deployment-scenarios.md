# Configurations for Deployment Scenarios
For performance and scalability planning purposes, we recommend that you plan your deployment topology for [!INCLUDE[smlong12](../../../sm/deploy/deploy-guide/includes/smlong12_md.md)] using scenarios that we have tested. While these are not firm guidelines, Microsoft has tested deployment topologies using these scenarios and found that each configuration achieves satisfactory performance.  
  
## Test and Small Deployment Scenarios  
 The test and small deployment scenarios contain only two servers and support 100 to 2,000 computers. In these configurations, a single physical computer hosts a virtual server.  
  
### Test Scenario  
 In this scenario, we recommend the following Service Manager roles and hardware as described.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[smshort](../../../sm/deploy/deploy-guide/includes/smshort_md.md)] roles:  
  
-   One computer with a [!INCLUDE[smshort](../../../sm/deploy/deploy-guide/includes/smshort_md.md)] management server, a [!INCLUDE[smshort](../../../sm/deploy/deploy-guide/includes/smshort_md.md)] database, SharePoint server\/site and web content server \(WCS\), and [!INCLUDE[smcons](../../../sm/deploy/deploy-guide/includes/smcons_md.md)].  
  
-   One data warehouse server. The [!INCLUDE[smssp](../../../sm/deploy/deploy-guide/includes/smssp_md.md)] should be placed on a computer other than the one hosting the data warehouse.  
  
 Hardware configuration:  
  
-   8\-core 2.66 GHz CPU  
  
-   16 GB RAM \(5 GB for each virtual computer and 1 GB for the host computer\)  
  
-   100 GB of available disk space  
  
 This configuration was tested with the following load.  
  
|Description|Value|  
|-----------------|-----------|  
|Number of Supported End Users|Up to 500|  
|Number of Computers in the  [!INCLUDE[smshort](../../../sm/deploy/deploy-guide/includes/smshort_md.md)] database|500|  
|Number of New Incidents per Month for each computer|2|  
|Number of New Change Requests per Month|20|  
|Number of Concurrent Consoles|2|  
|Is the [!INCLUDE[smssp](../../../sm/deploy/deploy-guide/includes/smssp_md.md)] Installed?|Yes|  
|Is the Active Directory Connector Enabled?|Yes|  
|Is the Configuration Manager Connector Enabled?|Yes|  
|Is the Operations Manager Connector Enabled?|Yes|  
  
### Small Scenario  
 In this scenario, we recommend the following hardware, configured for roles and hardware as described.  
  
 [!INCLUDE[smshort](../../../sm/deploy/deploy-guide/includes/smshort_md.md)] roles:  
  
-   One computer with a management server, [!INCLUDE[smshort](../../../sm/deploy/deploy-guide/includes/smshort_md.md)] database, and [!INCLUDE[smcons](../../../sm/deploy/deploy-guide/includes/smcons_md.md)].  
  
-   One data warehouse server. The [!INCLUDE[smssp](../../../sm/deploy/deploy-guide/includes/smssp_md.md)] should be placed on a physical host or on a virtual computer other than the computer hosting the data warehouse.  
  
 Hardware configuration:  
  
-   8\-core 2.66 GHz CPU  
  
-   16 GB RAM \(5 GB for each virtual computer and 1 GB for the host computer\)  
  
-   100 GB of available disk space, which does not include the .vhd file disk space requirements on the host computer  
  
 This configuration was tested with the following load.  
  
|Description|Value|  
|-----------------|-----------|  
|Number of Supported End Users|501 to 2,000|  
|Number of Computers in the  [!INCLUDE[smshort](../../../sm/deploy/deploy-guide/includes/smshort_md.md)] database|2,000|  
|Number of New Incidents per Month for each computer|2|  
|Number of New Change Requests per Month|100|
