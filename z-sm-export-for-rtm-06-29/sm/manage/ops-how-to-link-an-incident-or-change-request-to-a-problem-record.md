# How to Link an Incident or Change Request to a Problem Record
In System Center 2012 - Service Manager, you can use the following procedure to link an incident or change request to a problem record if you created a problem record without linking it to an existing incident or change request.  
  
### To link an incident or change request to a problem record  
  
1.  In the Service Manager console, click **Work Items**.  
  
2.  In the **Work Items** pane, expand **Problem Management**, and then click **Active Problems**.  
  
3.  In the **Active Problems** view, double\-click a problem record. For example, double\-click the **Outlook E\-mail Restricted Permissions** problem record.  
  
4.  In the problem form, click the **Related Items** tab.  
  
5.  Under **Work Items**, click **Add**.  
  
6.  In the **Select objects** dialog box, either select a work item or search for and select one or more work items to link to the problem record. Click **Add**, and then click **OK**.  
  
7.  Click **OK** to close the form.  
  
### To validate the link  
  
-   In the **Active Problems** view, open the problem record to which you linked a work item, click the **Related Items** tab, and then verify that the items you linked appear under **Work Items**.
