# Step 4: Move the Assembly Files to the Service Manager Console
In this step of the Woodgrove Bank customization scenario, in System Center 2012 - Service Manager Ken must move the workflow assembly file and the form assembly file to the Service Manager program directory to use the workflow with the Service Manager console.  
  
 For general information about deploying a workflow to Service Manager, see [How to Deploy a Workflow to Service Manager](../../../sm/manage/author/How-to-Deploy-a-Workflow-to-Service-Manager.md).  
  
### To move the assembly files  
  
1.  In Windows Explorer, open the folder in which you saved the management pack, and copy the **AddComputerToADGroupWF.dll** and **AddComputerToGroupFormAssembly.dll** files.  
  
2.  Open the Service Manager installation folder \(for example, C:\\Program Files\\Microsoft System Center\\Service Manager 2012\), and paste the copied files in that folder.
