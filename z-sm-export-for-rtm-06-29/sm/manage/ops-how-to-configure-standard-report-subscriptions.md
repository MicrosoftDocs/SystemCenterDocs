# How to Configure Standard Report Subscriptions
You can set up subscriptions to your reports in System Center 2012 - Service Manager through SQL&nbsp;Server Reporting Services \(SSRS\) Report Manager. Configuring a subscription to a report enables you to automate the delivery of a report. Report subscriptions can be sent through email, stored on the report server, or even posted to a Microsoft SharePoint site.  
  
### To create report subscriptions  
  
-   complete the procedures in the [Subscriptions and Delivery \(Reporting Services\)](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=158830) topic in the SQL&nbsp;Server&nbsp;2008&nbsp;R2 Books Online.
