# How to Edit a Service Request
In System Center 2012 - Service Manager, service requests are often created by end users by accessing the service catalog from the Self-Service Portal or by submitting email requests, and you might need to update a service request with additional information. You can use the following procedure to update a service request in the Service Manager console.  
  
### To edit a service request using the Service Manager console  
  
1.  In the Service Manager console, expand **Work Items**, expand **Service Request Fulfillment**, and then select a subnode, such as **Assigned To Me**.  
  
2.  In the list, select a service request to edit, and then in the **Tasks** pane under **\<Service Request ID - Service Request Name\>**, click **Edit**. For example, select **Request Membership to Active Directory Group**.  
  
3.  In the **\<SR\<ID\>: ServiceRequestName\>** form in the **Affected user** box, select the user who submitted the service request. For example, select **Joe Andreshak**.  
  
4.  Update any information in form as necessary, and then click **OK** to close the form.
