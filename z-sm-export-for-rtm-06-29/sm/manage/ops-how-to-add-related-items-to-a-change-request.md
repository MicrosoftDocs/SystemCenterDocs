# How to Add Related Items to a Change Request
In System Center 2012 - Service Manager, you can use the following procedures to add related items to a change request and then validate the addition of the items. You can add related items, such as configuration items, incidents, other change requests, files, and knowledge articles. When you add files, such as saved screen shots, saved written procedures, and knowledge articles, reviewers and implementers can more easily review, approve, and implement the change.  
  
 To add files to any work item, including change requests, you must first enable the appropriate option. For more information, see[How to Configure General Change Settings](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=178233) in the Service Manager Administratorâ€™s Guide.  
  
### To add related items to a change request  
  
1.  In the Service Manager console, click **Work Items**.  
  
2.  In the **Work Items** pane, expand **Change Management**, and then click **All Change Requests**.  
  
3.  In the **All Change Requests** pane, double\-click the change request to which you want to add an item.  
  
4.  Click the **Related Items** tab.  
  
5.  On the **Related Items** tab under **Attached Files**, click **Add** to attach a file to the change request.  
  
    > [!NOTE]  
    >  You might need to maximize the form to view buttons on the tab.  
  
6.  Under **Knowledge Articles**, click **Add** to attach a knowledge article to the change request.  
  
7.  Click **OK**.
