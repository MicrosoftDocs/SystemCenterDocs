# How to Put a Change Request on Hold
You can use the following procedures to put a change request on hold in System Center 2012 - Service Manager and then validate that the change request is on hold. For example, you might need to put a change request on hold if an external team needs to complete a manual activity.  
  
### To put a change request on hold  
  
1.  In the Service Manager console, click **Work Items**.  
  
2.  In the **Work Items** pane, expand **Work Items**, expand **Change Management**, and then click **Change Requests: Manual Activity In Progress**.  
  
3.  Select a change request to put on hold. For example, select **Apply Exchange Server&nbsp;2010 Service Pack&nbsp;1**.  
  
4.  In the **Tasks** pane, click **Put On Hold**.  
  
5.  In the **Comments** dialog box, type a note that indicates why the change request was put on hold, and then click **OK**.  
  
### To validate that the change request is on hold  
  
-   Click the **Change Requests: On Hold** view to ensure that the change request has been put on hold.
