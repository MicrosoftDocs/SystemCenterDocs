# How to Resolve a Parent Incident
In System Center 2012 - Service Manager, the help desk analyst  XE "Release Manager" can resolve a parent incident, and then Service Manager will automatically resolve all its child incidents, if the Service Manager administrator has configured Incident settings accordingly. This method of resolving incidents can help the analyst quickly close many child incidents. Use the following procedure to resolve a parent incident.  
  
### To resolve a parent incident  
  
1.  In the Service Manager console, open the Work Items workspace, and in the **Work Items** pane, expand **Incident Management**.  
  
2.  Select the **All Open Parent Incidents** view, and then in the list of parent incidents, select the incident that you want to resolve.  
  
3.  In the **Tasks** pane, click **Change Incident Status**, and then in the submenu, click **Resolve**.  
  
4.  In the **Resolve** dialog box, select a **Resolution Category**, and then in the **Comments** box, type a description of the steps that you have taken to resolve the incident.  
  
5.  If you want child incidents to resolve automatically and the option is available, ensure that the **Resolve child incidents when resolving this parent incident** option is selected, and then click **OK** to resolve the incidentâ€”and child incidents, if selected, and then close the **Resolve** dialog box.
