# How to Copy and Paste an Activity Within a Workflow
If your workflow uses multiple activities of the same type \(such as multiple Add AD DS Computer To Group activities\), you can use copy and paste functionality in the System Center 2016 - Service Manager Authoring Tool to quickly duplicate activities. To duplicate the values of the activity's properties with the activity, set values for the properties, and then copy and paste the activity.  
  
### To copy and paste an activity  
  
1.  In the **Management Pack Explorer**, expand **Workflows**, right\-click the workflow you want, and then click **Edit**. This opens the workflow in the authoring pane.  
  
2.  In the authoring pane, right\-click the activity, and then click **Copy**.  
  
3.  Do one of the following:  
  
    -   To paste the activity at the end of the workflow, right\-click the authoring pane, and then click **Paste**.  
  
    -   To paste the activity immediately after an existing activity, right\-click the existing activity, and then click **Paste**.
