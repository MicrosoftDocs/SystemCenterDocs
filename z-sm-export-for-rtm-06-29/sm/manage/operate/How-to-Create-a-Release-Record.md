# How to Create a Release Record
The Release Manager XE "Release Manager"  creates a release record in [!INCLUDE[smlong12](../../../sm/deploy/deploy-guide/includes/smlong12_md.md)] using the following procedure.  
  
### To create a release record  
  
1.  In the [!INCLUDE[smcons](../../../sm/deploy/deploy-guide/includes/smcons_md.md)], open the **Work Items** workspace, and in the **Work Items** pane, expand **Release Management**.  
  
2.  In the **Tasks** pane, click **Create Release Record**.  
  
3.  In the **Select Template** dialog box, select a release record template, and then click **OK** to open it.  
  
4.  In the release record form on the **General** tab, enter any necessary information, and then click the **Activities** tab.  
  
5.  Modify the default set of release activities that are added from the release record template, if any are present. You can add, delete, or modify sets of activities to the release record, including the following actions:  
  
    -   Add activities from the list of existing activity templates.  
  
    -   Move activities up and down in the order in which they are completed.  
  
    -   Move activities in the process list, and place them inside container activities.  
  
    -   Move activities from container activities, and place them anywhere in the process list.  
  
    -   Delete activities.  
  
6.  As you add an activity, the activity form opens. Enter necessary information, and then click **OK** to save the activity.  
  
7.  When you have added all the activities you want, click **OK** to save the release record and close it. The release record then appears in the **Release Records: All** view.
