# How to Cancel a Service Request
Occasionally, you might need to cancel a service request in [!INCLUDE[smlong12](../../../sm/deploy/deploy-guide/includes/smlong12_md.md)]. You can accomplish this by using the [!INCLUDE[smcons](../../../sm/deploy/deploy-guide/includes/smcons_md.md)]. You can use the following procedure to cancel a service request.  
  
### To cancel a service request

2.  In the **Work Items** pane, expand **Work Items**, expand **Service Request Fulfillment**, and then click **All Open Service Requests** or some other service request view.  
  
3.  Select the service request that you want to cancel. For example, select **Request Membership to Active Directory Group â€“ Joe Andreshak**.  
  
4.  In the **Tasks** pane, click **Cancel**.
