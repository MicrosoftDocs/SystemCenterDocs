# How to Promote a Release Record to a Parent Release Record
In [!INCLUDE[smlong12](../../../sm/deploy/deploy-guide/includes/smlong12_md.md)], the Release Manager XE "Release Manager"  can promote a release record to parent release record using the following procedure. A parent release record serves as a container for several releases.  
  
 The following procedure is performed on a release record that is neither a parent release record nor a child release record.  
  
### To promote a release record to a parent release record  
  
1.  In the [!INCLUDE[smcons](../../../sm/deploy/deploy-guide/includes/smcons_md.md)], open the **Work Items** workspace, and in the **Work Items** pane, expand **Release Management**.  
  
2.  Select any Release Management view, and then select a release record.  
  
3.  In the **Tasks** pane, click **Edit** to open the release record.  
  
4.  In the **Tasks** pane, click **Convert or Revert to Parent**.  
  
5.  In the **Comments** box, type a comment indicating that you have converted the release record to a parent release record, and then click **OK** to close the **Comments** box.  
  
6.  The **Child Items** tab appears in the form where you can add child release records.  
  
7.  In the release record form, click **OK** to close it.
