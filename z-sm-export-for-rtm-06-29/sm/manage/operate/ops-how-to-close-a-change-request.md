# How to Close a Change Request
In [!INCLUDE[smlong12](../../../sm/deploy/deploy-guide/includes/smlong12_md.md)], you can use the following procedures to permanently close a successful change request or a failed change request and then validate the closure of the change request. You cannot reopen a closed change request.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  If an end user cancels a software request before the software is deployed to the end userâ€™s computer, the associated change request might reflect the **In Progress** status indefinitely. If this occurs, cancel the request and then close it.  
  
### To close a successful change request  
  
1.  In the [!INCLUDE[smcons](../../../sm/deploy/deploy-guide/includes/smcons_md.md)], click **Work Items**.  
  
2.  In the **Work Items** pane, expand **Work Items**, expand **Change Management**, and then click **Change Requests: Completed**.  
  
3.  Select the change request.  
  
4.  In the **Tasks** pane, click **Close**.  
  
5.  In the **Comment** box, type a comment, and then click **OK**.  
  
### To close a failed change request  
  
1.  In the [!INCLUDE[smcons](../../../sm/deploy/deploy-guide/includes/smcons_md.md)], click **Work Items**.  
  
2.  In the **Work Items** pane, click **Change Management**, and then click **Change Requests: Failed**.  
  
3.  Select the change request.  
  
4.  In the **Tasks** pane, click **Close**.  
  
5.  In the **Comments** box, type a comment, and then click **OK**.
