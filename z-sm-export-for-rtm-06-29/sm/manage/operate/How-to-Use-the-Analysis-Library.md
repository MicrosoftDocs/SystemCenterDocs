# How to Use the Analysis Library
You can use the following procedure in [!INCLUDE[smlong12](../../../sm/deploy/deploy-guide/includes/smlong12_md.md)] to view Microsoft Excel workbooks that connect to Microsoft Online Analytical Processing \(OLAP\) data cubes by using the **Analysis Library** node in the Reporting workspace. Workbooks are saved to the Analysis Library by [!INCLUDE[smshort](../../../sm/deploy/deploy-guide/includes/smshort_md.md)] so that report users can easily access the workbooks.  
  
### To use the analysis library  
  
1.  In the [!INCLUDE[smcons](../../../sm/deploy/deploy-guide/includes/smcons_md.md)], click **Reporting**, expand the **Analysis Library** node, and then navigate to the folder that contains an Excel workbook that you want to open.  
  
2.  Select the Excel workbook that you want to open, and then in the **Tasks** list, click **Open Excel File**.  
  
3.  In the Excel workbook, you can refresh the data from the data warehouse. For example, if you are using Microsoft ExcelÂ 2010, you can click the **Data** tab and then click **Refresh All** to update the workbook.
