2.  Select any Release Management view that contains a child release record that you want to unlink from its parent release record.  
  
3.  In the **Tasks** pane, click **Link or Unlink to Existing Parent Release Record**, and then in the fly\-out list, click **Unlink**.  
  
4.  In the **Comments** box, type a comment indicating that you have unlinked the child release record from its parent release record, and then click **OK** to close the **Comments** box.
