# How to Add a Standard Report to the Service Manager Favorite Reports Folder
You can use the following procedure to add a report to the Favorite Reports folder in [!INCLUDE[smlong12](../../../sm/deploy/deploy-guide/includes/smlong12_md.md)].  
  
 After you have run several reports and determined the best parameters to use to customize the report contents, you can save a report to the Favorite Reports folder. This enables you to run the report directly from the **Reporting** view without having to specify parameters.  
  
### To save a report to the Favorite Reports folder  
  
1.  In the **Reporting** view, select the report that you want to use as the basis for the saved report, and then, in the **Tasks** pane, click **Run Report**.  
  
2.  In the report window, click **Save as Favorite Report** under **Tasks**.  
  
3.  Type a name for the report, and then click **OK**.  
  
4.  Close the report window.  
  
5.  In the **Reporting** navigation tree, click **Favorite Reports**.  
  
 The new report is displayed.
