# Creating and Deploying Dashboards
You can use PerformancePoint Dashboard Designer in [!INCLUDE[smlong12](../../../sm/deploy/deploy-guide/includes/smlong12_md.md)] to create and manage SharePoint dashboards and their elements to measure, monitor, and manage business performance with live data from the Service Manager data warehouse. Dashboards are mechanisms that display hierarchical arrangements of key performance indicators \(KPIs\).  
  
 You can use Dashboard Designer to define multiple filters for a dashboard, such as filters that are defined over time, by geography, or against different KPI destinations. When you publish dashboards to a SharePoint site, end users can navigate them by using page filters and drill\-up and drill\-down functionality. You can also use Dashboard Designer to create views and elements, such as scorecard elements, KPIs, data sources, indicators, and reports for use in dashboards.  
  
 This section is an example showing how you can create a PerformancePoint Services dashboard using the Analysis Services ServiceManager WorkItems Cube. This involves creating a data source for the cube and then creating a scorecard that and creating a resolved incidents KPI. Then, you can create an example single\-page dashboard using a filter, a scorecard, and a report. Finally, you complete the example by exploring the deployed dashboard and its interactive features. You must have Microsoft SharePoint Designer 2010 installed to complete the examples in the following topics.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  You must have the Enterprise edition of SharePoint Designer 2010 to create SharePoint PerformancePoint dashboards. For more information about upgrading to the Enterprise edition, see [Upgrade from a SharePoint Server 2010 Standard CAL to an Enterprise CAL](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc261946.aspx).
