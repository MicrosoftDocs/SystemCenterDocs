# Managing Incidents
The procedures in this section describe how to manage incidents by using [!INCLUDE[smlong12](../../../sm/deploy/deploy-guide/includes/smlong12_md.md)].  
  
 For a detailed description of the complete scenarios for managing incidents and problems, see [Sample Scenarios: Managing Incidents and Problems](../Topic/Sample%20Scenarios:%20Managing%20Incidents%20and%20Problems.md).  
  
 Help desk analysts use incident management to restore regular operations as quickly and as cost\-effectively as possible by creating new incidents. They also work in partnership with [!INCLUDE[smshort](../../../sm/deploy/deploy-guide/includes/smshort_md.md)] administrators to ensure that incidents that are created automatically or by end users are correctly categorized and reassigned to appropriate personnel. Methods that analysts use to accomplish these duties include:  
  
-   Using the E\-mail Incident template to create new incidents.  
  
-   Reviewing automatically created incidents, such as those incidents that are automatically created from System Center Operations ManagerÂ 2007 using the Operations Manager Alert connector.  
  
-   Reviewing and updating incidents that are created by end users who have sent requests by email.  
  
-   Combining incidents into parent\-child relationships when incidents are related.  
  
 To manage an incident, complete the steps in the following table.
