# How to Resume a Change Request
You can use the following procedures to resume a change request that was put on hold in [!INCLUDE[smlong12](../../../sm/deploy/deploy-guide/includes/smlong12_md.md)] and then validate that the change request was resumed. For example, you might need to resume a change request after an external team has completed a manual activity.  
  
### To resume a change request  
  
1.  In the [!INCLUDE[smcons](../../../sm/deploy/deploy-guide/includes/smcons_md.md)], click **Work Items**.  
  
2.  In the **Work Items** pane, expand **Work Items**, expand **Change Management**, and then click **Change Requests: On Hold**.  
  
3.  Select a change request. For example, select **Apply Exchange Server 2010 Service Pack 1**.  
  
4.  In the **Tasks** pane, click **Resume**.  
  
5.  In the **Comments** dialog box, type a comment, and then click **OK**.  
  
### To validate the change request was resumed  
  
-   If the current activity for a change request is a review activity, click the **Change Requests: In Review** view to ensure that the change request was resumed.  
  
-   If the current activity for a change request is a manual activity, click the **Change Requests: Manual Activity In Progress** view to ensure that the change request was resumed.
