# Combining Release Records into Parent-Child Groups
In [!INCLUDE[smlong12](../../../sm/deploy/deploy-guide/includes/smlong12_md.md)], releases are normally deployed to production environments at intervals you define. For example, you can package several releases into monthly batches. You can define each batch as a parent release, which consolidates and links other smaller project\-specific releases into a monthly package. This process can help you verify that all child releases are evaluated together.
