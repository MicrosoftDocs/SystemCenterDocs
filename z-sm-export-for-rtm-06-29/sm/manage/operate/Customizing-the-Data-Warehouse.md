# Customizing the Data Warehouse
After the [!INCLUDE[smlong12](../../../sm/deploy/deploy-guide/includes/smlong12_md.md)] data warehouse is deployed and you have viewed its reports, you can customize the information in the reports to better suit your organization. For example, you might want to recreate reports that you have used in the past with other information systems using Service Manager. Or, you might want to customize the reports for your internal business processes for incidents or change management.  
  
 The information in this section can help you determine how to extend and customize the data warehouse to enable in\-depth analyses.
