# Searching for Information in System Center 2012 - Service Manager
In [!INCLUDE[smlong12](../../../sm/deploy/deploy-guide/includes/smlong12_md.md)], you can use the search feature in the [!INCLUDE[smcons](../../../sm/deploy/deploy-guide/includes/smcons_md.md)] to look for information. The search box is in the upper\-right corner of the [!INCLUDE[smcons](../../../sm/deploy/deploy-guide/includes/smcons_md.md)]. By default, the search feature looks for all objects. The results can include incidents, change requests, problems, and configuration items of Windows\-based computers. You can filter search results by using the filter bar. You can also perform an advanced search for these items plus the following items:  
  
-   Knowledge articles  
  
-   Domain users  
  
-   Manual activities  
  
 However, only knowledge articles are returned when you perform a knowledge search.  
  
 When you search for most items in [!INCLUDE[smshort](../../../sm/deploy/deploy-guide/includes/smshort_md.md)], only exact keyword matches return results. However, partial matches are returned for configuration items of Windows\-based computers. Searches that use wildcard characters are not supported.  
  
 When you search for items, you open a view that displays a large number of items, and there are more than 5,000 items in the results, the complete results can take a few minutes to appear.
