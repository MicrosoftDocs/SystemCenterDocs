# Managing Problems
The procedures in this section describe how to manage problems in [!INCLUDE[smlong12](../../../sm/deploy/deploy-guide/includes/smlong12_md.md)].  
  
 For a detailed description of the complete scenario for managing problems, see [Sample Scenarios: Managing Incidents and Problems](../Topic/Sample%20Scenarios:%20Managing%20Incidents%20and%20Problems.md).  
  
 In [!INCLUDE[smshort](../../../sm/deploy/deploy-guide/includes/smshort_md.md)], problems are records that are created to help prevent future problems and incidents from happening, to eliminate recurring incidents, and to minimize the impact of incidents that cannot be prevented. Analysts can use the [!INCLUDE[smcons](../../../sm/deploy/deploy-guide/includes/smcons_md.md)] to create problem records and to associate incidents with problems.  
  
 Complete these steps to manage problems in [!INCLUDE[smshort](../../../sm/deploy/deploy-guide/includes/smshort_md.md)].
