# How to Approve and Complete a Service Request Using Activities
In [!INCLUDE[smlong12](../../../sm/deploy/deploy-guide/includes/smlong12_md.md)], you can use the following procedures to approve a review activity and complete a manual activity for a service request in the [!INCLUDE[smcons](../../../sm/deploy/deploy-guide/includes/smcons_md.md)]. In many cases, multiple people or groups must vote to approve a single review activity before its approval is final. After approval, a service request might need a manual activity completed to verify that the service was provided to the requesting user and to close the service request.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Users can only approve or reject and close the activities that are assigned to them.  
  
### To approve a review activity for a service request  
  
1.  In the [!INCLUDE[smcons](../../../sm/deploy/deploy-guide/includes/smcons_md.md)], click **Work Items**.  
  
2.  In the **Work Items** pane, expand **Work Items**, expand **Activity Management**, expand **Review Activities**, and then click **Activities Assigned to Me**.  
  
3.  Select a review activity. For example, select the **Approval for the user requesting membership to an Active Directory group**.  
  
4.  In the **Tasks** pane, click **Approve**.  
  
5.  In the **Comments** dialog box, type any comments that you have for the approval or rejection, and then click **OK**.
