# Modifying the Default Toolbox
If the default set of Windows Workflow Foundation \(WF\) activities does not meet the needs of your organization, you can use custom activities with the [!INCLUDE[smatfull2012](../../../sm/manage/author/includes/smatfull2012_md.md)]. Custom activities include activities you or your organization develops or activities that non\-Microsoft parties develop. These activities must be compiled into assembly files \(*activitysetname*.dll\). For information about developing WF activities, see the [Workflow Activity Reference](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=233694).  
  
 Installing or removing custom activity assemblies changes the set of available activities for all [!INCLUDE[scauthoringshort](../../../sm/manage/author/includes/scauthoringshort_md.md)] users. When you install or remove an activity assembly, remember to notify [!INCLUDE[scauthoringshort](../../../sm/manage/author/includes/scauthoringshort_md.md)] users of the changes. Custom activities do not appear automatically in the Activities Toolbox; in order to use custom activities, users must add them to personalized activity groups. For more information, see [How to Add Activities to a Personalized Activity Group](../../../sm/manage/author/How-to-Add-Activities-to-a-Personalized-Activity-Group.md).
