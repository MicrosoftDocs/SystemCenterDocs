# How to Copy a Workflow
Use this procedure to create a copy of a workflow in the [!INCLUDE[smatfull2012](../../../sm/manage/author/includes/smatfull2012_md.md)]. After you copy the workflow, you can edit the properties of either the copy or the original, as described in [How to Edit a Workflow's Details](../../../sm/manage/author/How-to-Edit-a-Workflow-s-Details.md).  
  
### To copy a workflow  
  
-   In the **Management Pack Explorer**, expand **Workflow**, right\-click the workflow you want to copy, and then click **Copy**.  
  
     The [!INCLUDE[scauthoringshort](../../../sm/manage/author/includes/scauthoringshort_md.md)] creates a copy of the workflow and gives it a name that consists of the original workflow name and "\_Copy."
