# Working with Management Pack XML Files
For elaborate customizations of management packs, the [!INCLUDE[smcons](../../../sm/deploy/deploy-guide/includes/smcons_md.md)] and the  [!INCLUDE[smatfull2012](../../../sm/manage/author/includes/smatfull2012_md.md)] might not be sufficient, and you might need to author or modify management pack files directly. Working directly with management pack files requires in\-depth knowledge in several areas, such as the System Center Common Schema and the structure of management packs.  
  
 This section provides background information and guidelines that can help you author and modify management packs to customize [!INCLUDE[smshort](../../../sm/deploy/deploy-guide/includes/smshort_md.md)].
