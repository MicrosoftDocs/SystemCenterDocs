# Creating Workflows for IT Processes
To use a workflow to automate a process in the [!INCLUDE[smatfull2012](../../../sm/manage/author/includes/smatfull2012_md.md)], you must define what the workflow should do, when it should run, and what information it needs. You can start with general definitions and then refine them until you have details that you can work with in [!INCLUDE[smshort](../../../sm/deploy/deploy-guide/includes/smshort_md.md)].
