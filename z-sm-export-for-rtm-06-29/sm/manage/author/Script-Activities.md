# Script Activities
Use a script activity in [!INCLUDE[smlong12](../../../sm/deploy/deploy-guide/includes/smlong12_md.md)] to run a script as part of a workflow.  
  
 Script activities run as a separate process from the workflows; however, they also run under the security context of the Service Manager Workflow account.  
  
 The [!INCLUDE[smatfull2012](../../../sm/manage/author/includes/smatfull2012_md.md)] provides the following three default script activities in the **Generic Script Activities** subgroup of the **Script Activities** group in the **Activities Toolbox** pane.
