# How to Edit Details of a Class in the Authoring Tool
You can use the [!INCLUDE[smatfull2012](../../../sm/manage/author/includes/smatfull2012_md.md)] to view the properties of a class and to edit the details, such as the name or description, of a class.  
  
 In the **Management Pack Explorer**, you can select a class and view its details in the **Details** pane. If you select a class that is defined in an unsealed management pack, you can change the name and description of that class.  
  
### To change the name or description of a class  
  
1.  On your desktop, click **Start**.  
  
2.  Click **Service Manager Authoring Tool**, and wait for the [!INCLUDE[scauthoringshort](../../../sm/manage/author/includes/scauthoringshort_md.md)] to open.  
  
3.  Ensure that both the **Management Pack Explorer** and the **Details** panes are open.  
  
4.  Click **File**, and then click **Open**.  
  
5.  In the **Open File** dialog box, select an unsealed management pack that contains the class that you want to change, and then click **Open**. For example, open the \<*Authoring Tool installation folder*\> \\Samples\\Woodgrove.AutomatedActivity.AddComputerToGroupMP.xml sample management pack.  
  
6.  In the **Management Pack Explorer**, expand the management pack that contains the class that you want to change.  
  
7.  Expand **Classes**, and then locate and select the class that you want to change.  
  
8.  Select the value of the **Name** or **Description** property, and then enter the new value. Values that cannot be changed are unavailable.  
  
9. In the **Management Pack Explorer**, right\-click the management pack that contains the changed class, and then click **Save**.
