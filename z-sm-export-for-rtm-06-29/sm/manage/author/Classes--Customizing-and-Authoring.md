# Classes: Customizing and Authoring
A class is the main element that is used to represent objects that are used in [!INCLUDE[smlong12](../../../sm/deploy/deploy-guide/includes/smlong12_md.md)]. A class can represent a computer, a user, an incident, or a form.  
  
 Class definitions that represent a larger element, such as a [!INCLUDE[smshort](../../../sm/deploy/deploy-guide/includes/smshort_md.md)] feature, are often grouped together. Class definitions are stored in management packs that must be imported into [!INCLUDE[smshort](../../../sm/deploy/deploy-guide/includes/smshort_md.md)] to enable [!INCLUDE[smshort](../../../sm/deploy/deploy-guide/includes/smshort_md.md)] functionality.
