# Overview of Management Packs
Management packs in [!INCLUDE[smlong12](../../../sm/deploy/deploy-guide/includes/smlong12_md.md)] are XML\-based files that contain definitions for classes, workflows, views, forms, and reports. You can use management packs to do the following:  
  
-   Extend [!INCLUDE[smshort](../../../sm/deploy/deploy-guide/includes/smshort_md.md)] with new objects  
  
-   Extend [!INCLUDE[smshort](../../../sm/deploy/deploy-guide/includes/smshort_md.md)] with new behavior  
  
-   Store new custom objects that you created, such as forms or templates.  
  
-   Transport customizations to another [!INCLUDE[smshort](../../../sm/deploy/deploy-guide/includes/smshort_md.md)] deployment or implement the customizations in a newer deployment  
  
 You can use management packs to extend [!INCLUDE[smshort](../../../sm/deploy/deploy-guide/includes/smshort_md.md)] with the definitions and the information necessary to implement all or part of a service management process.  
  
 By default, the [!INCLUDE[smshort](../../../sm/deploy/deploy-guide/includes/smshort_md.md)] installation folder contains several preimported management packs that enable core [!INCLUDE[smshort](../../../sm/deploy/deploy-guide/includes/smshort_md.md)] features, such as incident management and change management.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  Unsealed management packs are not automatically upgraded during an upgrade to [!INCLUDE[smlong12](../../../sm/deploy/deploy-guide/includes/smlong12_md.md)].
