# Active Directory Activities
Use Active Directory Domain Services \(AD DS\) activities to make Active Directory functions part of your workflow in [!INCLUDE[smlong12](../../../sm/deploy/deploy-guide/includes/smlong12_md.md)].  
  
 The [!INCLUDE[smatfull2012](../../../sm/manage/author/includes/smatfull2012_md.md)] provides two default [!INCLUDE[smshort](../../../sm/deploy/deploy-guide/includes/smshort_md.md)] activities in the **Active Directory Activities** group in the **Activities Toolbox** pane. The topics in this section describe these activities.
