# Workflows: Customizing and Authoring
Using [!INCLUDE[smlong12](../../../sm/deploy/deploy-guide/includes/smlong12_md.md)], you can automate many administrative processes that previously required manual tasks. The feature that makes this automation possible is the Windows Workflow Foundation \(WF\) workflow. A WF workflow comprises workflow activities, which are also referred to as *WF activities* to differentiate them from other [!INCLUDE[smshort](../../../sm/deploy/deploy-guide/includes/smshort_md.md)] activity types. Each workflow activity performs a function, such as joining a user or a computer to a group in Active Directory Domain Services \(ADÂ DS\), creating a [!INCLUDE[smshort](../../../sm/deploy/deploy-guide/includes/smshort_md.md)] incident, or running a script. You can assemble WF activities into a workflow that performs a set of tasks, and you can specify the conditions under which the workflow runs.
