# Managing Workflows
Use the procedures in this section to create or delete workflows in the [!INCLUDE[smatfull2012](../../../sm/manage/author/includes/smatfull2012_md.md)]. The [!INCLUDE[scauthoringshort](../../../sm/manage/author/includes/scauthoringshort_md.md)] provides a wizard to help you create workflows.  
  
 All workflows run under the security context of the [!INCLUDE[smshort](../../../sm/deploy/deploy-guide/includes/smshort_md.md)] Workflow account.  
  
 If you are following the Woodgrove Bank customization scenario, proceed to [How to Create a New Workflow](../../../sm/manage/author/How-to-Create-a-New-Workflow.md).
