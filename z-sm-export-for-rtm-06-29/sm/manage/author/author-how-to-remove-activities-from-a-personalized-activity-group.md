# How to Remove Activities from a Personalized Activity Group
Use this procedure to remove activities from a personalized activity group in the [!INCLUDE[smatfull2012](../../../sm/manage/author/includes/smatfull2012_md.md)]. Note that removing an activity from a group does not remove the activity from the Activity Library or from any other group.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  You can only remove activities from personalized activity groups. You cannot remove activities from  the default activity groups.  
  
### To remove activities from a personalized activity group  
  
1.  In the **Activities Toolbox** pane, right\-click the group, and then click **Choose Activities**.  
  
2.  In the **Choose Activities for a Group** dialog box, scroll the list to find the activities you want to remove. Clear the check boxes for the activities you want to remove, and then click **OK**.
