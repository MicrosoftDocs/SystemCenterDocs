# How to Set an Activity Property to a Constant Value
In the Woodgrove Bank customization scenario, Ken uses this procedure to set the **Active Directory name** property of the **Add AD DS Computer to Group** activity.  
  
 Use this procedure in the [!INCLUDE[smatfull2012](../../../sm/manage/author/includes/smatfull2012_md.md)] to set a property to a constant value \(also referred to as a literal value\). This value applies anytime this workflow starts.  
  
### To set an activity property to a constant value  
  
1.  In the authoring pane, click the activity you want. The **Details** pane becomes active, and it displays the properties for this activity.  
  
     For example, in the **AddComputertoADGroupWF** workflow, click the **Add AD DS Computer to Group** activity.  
  
2.  In the **Details** pane, click the property you want to set, and in the text box, type a value.  
  
     For example, for the **Add AD DS Computer to Group** activity, click **Computer Domain name**, and in the text box, type **woodgrove.com**.
