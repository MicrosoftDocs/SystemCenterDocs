# How to Browse a Form in the Authoring Tool
Use one of the following two procedures to browse a form in the [!INCLUDE[smatfull2012](../../../sm/manage/author/includes/smatfull2012_md.md)]. In both procedures, note that the properties in the **Details** pane are updated according to the class property that is bound to the selected control. And, note that the **Binding Path** entry in the **Details** pane indicates the respective property that the field in the form represents.  
  
### To browse a form from the Form Browser  
  
1.  If the **Form Browser** pane is not visible, click **View**, and then click the **Form Browser** tab.  
  
2.  In the **Form Browser** pane, select the management pack that contains the form that you want to view.  
  
3.  In the list of forms, right\-click the form that you want to view, and then click **View**. The form opens in the authoring pane.  
  
4.  Ensure that the **Details** pane is visible. If not, click **View** on the menu bar, and then click **Details Window**. The properties of the form appear in the **Details** pane.  
  
5.  Select a control on the form.  
  
### To browse a form from Management Pack Explorer  
  
1.  In the [!INCLUDE[scauthoringshort](../../../sm/manage/author/includes/scauthoringshort_md.md)], click **File**, and then click **Open**.  
  
2.  In the **Open a Management Pack** dialog box, select the management pack that contains the form that you want to view. For example, select **Management Packs** as the file type, and then select the **ServiceManager.ChangeManagement.Library.mp** management pack in the D:\\Program Files \(x86\)\\Microsoft System Center\\Service Manager 2012 Authoring\\Library folder.  
  
3.  In the **Management Pack Explorer**, select the opened management pack, and then expand **Forms**. Right\-click the form that you want to view, and then click **View form**. The form opens in the authoring pane.  
  
4.  Ensure that the **Details** pane is visible. If not, click **View** on the menu bar, and then click **Details Window**. The properties of the form appear in the **Details** pane.
