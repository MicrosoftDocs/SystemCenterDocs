# How to Copy and Paste an Activity Within a Workflow
If your workflow uses multiple activities of the same type \(such as multiple Add AD DS Computer To Group activities\), you can use copy and paste functionality in the [!INCLUDE[smatfull2012](../../../sm/manage/author/includes/smatfull2012_md.md)] to quickly duplicate activities. To duplicate the values of the activityâ€™s properties with the activity, set values for the properties, and then copy and paste the activity.  
  
### To copy and paste an activity  
  
1.  In the **Management Pack Explorer**, expand **Workflows**, right\-click the workflow you want, and then click **Edit**. This opens the workflow in the authoring pane.  
  
2.  In the authoring pane, right\-click the activity, and then click **Copy**.  
  
3.  Do one of the following:  
  
    -   To paste the activity at the end of the workflow, right\-click the authoring pane, and then click **Paste**.  
  
    -   To paste the activity immediately after an existing activity, right\-click the existing activity, and then click **Paste**.
