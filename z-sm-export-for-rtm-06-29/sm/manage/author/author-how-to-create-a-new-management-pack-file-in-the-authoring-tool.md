# How to Create a New Management Pack File in the Authoring Tool
To be able to implement customizations that you make in the [!INCLUDE[smatfull2012](../../../sm/manage/author/includes/smatfull2012_md.md)], you have to save them to a management pack file.  
  
 If you customize an object from a sealed management pack, you will not be able to save that customization in the original sealed management pack. In this case, you can either use an existing unsealed management pack or you can create a new management pack, which by default will be unsealed.  
  
 You can use the following procedure to create a new management pack file.  
  
### To create a new management pack file  
  
1.  On your desktop, click **Start**.  
  
2.  Click **Service Manager Authoring Tool**, and wait for the [!INCLUDE[scauthoringshort](../../../sm/manage/author/includes/scauthoringshort_md.md)] to open.  
  
3.  In the [!INCLUDE[scauthoringshort](../../../sm/manage/author/includes/scauthoringshort_md.md)], on the menu bar, click **File**, and then click **New**.  
  
4.  In the **New Management Pack** dialog box, enter a file name and a location for the new management pack file.  
  
     Ensure that the file name that you enter does not contain spaces or special characters, and do not specify the [!INCLUDE[scauthoringshort](../../../sm/manage/author/includes/scauthoringshort_md.md)] installation folder as the location for new and customized management pack files.  
  
5.  Click **Open**.  
  
6.  In the **Management Pack Explorer**, verify that the new management pack is listed.
