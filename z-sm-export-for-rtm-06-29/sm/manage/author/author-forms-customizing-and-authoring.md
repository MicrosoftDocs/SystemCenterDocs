# Forms: Customizing and Authoring
A form is a window that makes it possible for users to interact with objects from the database. Users can use a form to view and edit the properties of objects. Each form is tied to a specific class, and it displays information only for instances of the targeted class. A form contains fields. Typically, each field is bound to a specific property of the form’s targeted class. The incident form, for example, is tied to the incident object. Therefore, the incident form displays information about incident objects in the database.  
  
 A [!INCLUDE[smlong12](../../../sm/deploy/deploy-guide/includes/smlong12_md.md)] form consists of the Windows Presentation Foundation \(WPF\) form implementation in a Microsoft .NET Framework assembly and a form definition in a [!INCLUDE[smshort](../../../sm/deploy/deploy-guide/includes/smshort_md.md)] management pack. The form definition specifies the class that the form represents, along with the other properties of the form.
