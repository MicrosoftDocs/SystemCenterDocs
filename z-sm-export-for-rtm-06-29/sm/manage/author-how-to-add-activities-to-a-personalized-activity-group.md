# How to Add Activities to a Personalized Activity Group
Use this procedure to add activities to a personalized activity group in the System Center 2016 - Service Manager Authoring Tool. Activities can belong to more than one group; for example, you can create a **Favorites** group and populate it with both default activities and custom activities that already belong to other groups.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  You can only add activities to personalized activity groups. You cannot add activities to the default activity groups.  
  
 If you want to use custom activities in workflows, you must add them to a group in order to make them available in the **Activities Toolbox** pane. Note that before you can add custom activities to groups, an administrator must install the appropriate activity assembly files on the computer running the Authoring Tool. For more information, see [Modifying the Default Toolbox](../../../sm/manage/author/Modifying-the-Default-Toolbox.md).  
  
### To add activities to a personalized activity group  
  
1.  In the **Activities Toolbox** pane, right\-click the group, and then click **Choose Activities**.  
  
2.  In the **Choose Activities for a Group** dialog box, scroll the list to find the activities you want to add. Select the check boxes for the activities you want to add.  
  
3.  If you want to use custom activities that do not appear in the list, click **Add Custom Activities**. In the **Select Custom Activity Assembly** dialog box, select the custom activity assembly file, and then click **Open**. This adds the custom activities from this assembly file to the activity list.  
  
4.  After you have selected all of the activities for the group, click **OK**.
