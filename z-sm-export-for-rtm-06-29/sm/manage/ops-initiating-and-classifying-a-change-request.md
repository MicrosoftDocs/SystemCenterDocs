# Initiating and Classifying a Change Request
The procedures in this section describe how to initiate and classify a change request in System Center 2012 - Service Manager from start to finish.  
  
 For a detailed description of the complete scenario for initiating and classifying a change request, see [Sample Scenario: Managing Changes and Activities](../Topic/Sample%20Scenario:%20Managing%20Changes%20and%20Activities.md).  
  
 A change request normally results in a change to a configuration item. Therefore, it is important to understand the difference between a related item and a linked or affected item. A related item indicates that an association exists between the change request and a configuration item or other change requests. In other words, the change request might affect the related item or it might not. An affected or linked item indicates that the change request is tied directly to the item and that the change will affect the item itself.  
  
 Complete the following steps to initiate and classify a change request.
