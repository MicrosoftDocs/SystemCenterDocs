# How to Add a List Picker Control to a Form in the Authoring Tool
The **List Picker** control in the System Center 2016 - Service Manager Authoring Tool is a System Center 2012 - Service Manager custom control that is used for selecting an item from a prepopulated list of items. You can modify properties of the **List Picker** control to customize the characteristics of the control.  
  
 One of the characteristics of the control that you have to set is the list of items that will populate the **List Picker** control that you are creating. You can either choose an existing list, such as the **Activity Priority** list, or you can create a new list while you are creating the control.  
  
 To add list items to a newly created list, you must use the Service Manager console. You cannot use the Authoring Tool to add list items to a newly created list. For more information about using the Service Manager console to add list items, see [How to Add a List Item](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=231881).  
  
 Use the following procedure to add a **List Picker** control to a form.  
  
### To add a List Picker control to a form  
  
1.  Ensure that the **Form Customization Toolbox** pane is open and that the form that you want to customize is open in the authoring pane.  
  
2.  Drag the **List Picker** icon from the **Form Customization Toolbox** pane to the form. Click the **List Picker** control on the form.  
  
3.  In the **Details** pane, select the **List type** property, and then click the ellipsis \(**...**\) icon. In the **Select a list** dialog box, select the list of items that will populate the **List Picker** control that you are creating. Select a list from the **Available lists** list.  
  
     Click **OK**.  
  
4.  Click any other property, such as **Width** or **Height**, in the **Details** pane to customize other properties of the **List Picker** control.  
  
5.  Click **File**, and then click **Save All** to save the custom form to a management pack.
