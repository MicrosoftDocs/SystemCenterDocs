# Adding or Removing Workflow Activities
Workflow activities are the building blocks of a workflow. You can use the procedures in this section to add activities to a workflow; remove, copy, and paste activities; and configure specialized activities to import Windows PowerShell scripts into your workflow.  
  
 If you are following the Woodgrove Bank customization scenario, see [How to Add an Activity to a Workflow](../../../sm/manage/author/How-to-Add-an-Activity-to-a-Workflow.md).
