# Configuring the Activities Toolbox
There are two ways to configure the Activities Toolbox in the System Center 2016 - Service Manager Authoring Tool:  
  
-   Modify the default toolbox by adding or removing custom activities. These changes require administrative\-level permissions, and they are visible to all users of the Authoring Tool.  
  
-   Personalize the toolbox. These changes do not require special permissions. Changes made by one user affect only that user.
