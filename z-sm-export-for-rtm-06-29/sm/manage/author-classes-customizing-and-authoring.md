# Classes: Customizing and Authoring
A class is the main element that is used to represent objects that are used in System Center 2012 - Service Manager. A class can represent a computer, a user, an incident, or a form.  
  
 Class definitions that represent a larger element, such as a Service Manager feature, are often grouped together. Class definitions are stored in management packs that must be imported into Service Manager to enable Service Manager functionality.
