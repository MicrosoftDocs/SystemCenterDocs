# Managing Workflows
Use the procedures in this section to create or delete workflows in the System Center 2016 - Service Manager Authoring Tool. The Authoring Tool provides a wizard to help you create workflows.  
  
 All workflows run under the security context of the Service Manager Workflow account.  
  
 If you are following the Woodgrove Bank customization scenario, proceed to [How to Create a New Workflow](../../../sm/manage/author/How-to-Create-a-New-Workflow.md).
