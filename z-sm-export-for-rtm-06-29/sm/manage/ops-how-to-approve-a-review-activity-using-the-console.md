# How to Approve a Review Activity Using the Console
In System Center 2012 - Service Manager, you can use the following procedures to approve a review activity in the Service Manager console and then validate the approval. In many cases, multiple people or groups must vote to approve a single review activity before its approval is final.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  Users can only approve or reject the activities that are assigned to them.  
  
### To approve a review activity for a change request  
  
1.  In the Service Manager console, click **Work Items**.  
  
2.  In the **Work Items** pane, expand **Work Items**, expand **Activity Management**, expand **Review Activities**, and then click **In\-Progress Activities**.  
  
3.  Select a review activity. For example, select the **Messaging Infrastructure Request Approval**.  
  
4.  In the **Tasks** pane, click **Approve**.  
  
5.  In the **Comments** dialog box, type any comments that you have for the approval or rejection, and then click **OK**.  
  
### To validate review activity approval  
  
-   If all the reviewers approved the activity, the activity does not appear in the **In\-Progress Activities** view.  
  
-   If an activity is still in progress, it requires approval from other reviewers. Click **In\-Progress Activities**, and then open the activity to view your voting status.
