# How to Add a Check Box Control to a Form in the Authoring Tool
A **Check Box** control in System Center 2016 - Service Manager Authoring Tool presents an option on the form, and lets the user choose that option. You can modify the properties of the **Check Box** control to customize characteristics such as the label that is displayed on the check box.  
  
 Use the following procedure to add a **Check Box** control to a form.  
  
### To add a Check Box control to a form  
  
1.  Ensure that the **Form Customization Toolbox** pane is open and that the form that you want to customize is open in the authoring pane.  
  
2.  Drag the **Check Box** icon from the **Form Customization Toolbox** pane to the form. Click the **Check Box** control on the form.  
  
3.  In the **Details** pane, select the **Content** property and set its value to text that will be displayed on the check box.  
  
4.  In the **Details** pane, select the **Binding Path** property, and then click the ellipsis \(**â€¦**\) icon. In the **Binding Path** dialog box, expand the classes, and then select a **Boolean** property for the control to bind to. Note that the **Content** property is automatically set to the display name of the property that the control is bound to.  
  
5.  Click any other property, such as **Font Family**, in the **Details** pane to customize the properties of the **Check Box** control.
