# How to Add a Label Control to a Form in the Authoring Tool
A **Label** control is used in the System Center 2016 - Service Manager Authoring Tool for displaying a label on a form. You can modify the properties of the **Label** control to customize characteristics such as the text string that the label displays.  
  
 Use the following procedure to add a **Label** control to a form.  
  
### To add a Label control to a form  
  
1.  Ensure that the **Form Customization Toolbox** pane is open and that the form that you want to customize is open in the authoring pane.  
  
2.  Drag the **Label** icon from the **Form Customization Toolbox** pane to the form. Click the **Label** control on the form.  
  
3.  In the **Details** pane, select the **Binding Path** property. Click the ellipsis \(**...**\) icon, and then in the **Binding Path** dialog box, select the class property that you want the **Label** control to bind to.  
  
     Alternatively, if you want the **Label** control to display a static string, select the **Content** property and type a string to replace the default Label\_1 string. It will be displayed on the form.  
  
4.  Click any other property in the **Details** pane to customize properties of the **Label** control.  
  
5.  Click **File**, and then click **Save All** to save the custom form to a management pack.
