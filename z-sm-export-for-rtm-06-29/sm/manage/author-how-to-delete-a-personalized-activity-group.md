# How to Delete a Personalized Activity Group
Use this procedure to delete an activity group in the System Center 2016 - Service Manager Authoring Tool. If the activity group contains one or more subgroups, the subgroups will also be deleted. Note that deleting an activity group does not remove its member activities from the Activity Library or from any other groups.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  You can only delete personalized activity groups. You cannot delete the default activity groups.  
  
### To delete a personalized activity group  
  
-   In the **Activities Toolbox** pane, right\-click the group, and then click **Delete Group**.
