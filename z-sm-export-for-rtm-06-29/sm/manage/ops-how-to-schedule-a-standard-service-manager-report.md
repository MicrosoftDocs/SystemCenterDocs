# How to Schedule a Standard Service Manager Report
In System Center 2012 - Service Manager, you can schedule a linked report to run on a regular basis to ensure that the information is up to date. To do this, use SQL Server Reporting Services \(SSRS\) Report Manager. In SSRS Report Manager, you can schedule reports to run one time or on a continuous basis at intervals of hours, days, weeks, or months. You can do the following:  
  
-   Schedule report delivery in a standard or data\-driven subscription.  
  
-   Schedule report history so that new snapshots are added to the report history at regular intervals.  
  
-   Schedule time to refresh the data of a report snapshot.  
  
-   Schedule the expiration of a cached report to occur at a predefined time so that it can be refreshed later.  
  
 To configure a schedule for a report, complete the procedure in the [Scheduling Reports, Shared Datasets, and Subscriptions](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=158822) topic in SQL Server 2008 R2 Books Online.
