# How to Save and Build a Workflow
Workflows are saved whenever you save the management pack. In addition, when you save a management pack, the System Center 2016 - Service Manager Authoring Tool automatically identifies the Windows Workflow Foundation \(WF\) workflow files that are associated with the workflow information in the management pack and builds them into workflow assemblies. \(Each WF workflow may have multiple raw files.\) The tool builds one assembly per workflow.  
  
 For more information about the relationships between workflows, management pack files, and workflow assembly files, see [Workflows and Management Packs](../../../sm/manage/author/Workflows-and-Management-Packs.md).  
  
### To save and build workflows  
  
-   In the **Management Pack Explorer**, right\-click the management pack, and then click **Save**.
