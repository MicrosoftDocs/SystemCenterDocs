# Overview of Management Packs
Management packs in System Center 2012 - Service Manager are XML\-based files that contain definitions for classes, workflows, views, forms, and reports. You can use management packs to do the following:  
  
-   Extend Service Manager with new objects  
  
-   Extend Service Manager with new behavior  
  
-   Store new custom objects that you created, such as forms or templates.  
  
-   Transport customizations to another Service Manager deployment or implement the customizations in a newer deployment  
  
 You can use management packs to extend Service Manager with the definitions and the information necessary to implement all or part of a service management process.  
  
 By default, the Service Manager installation folder contains several preimported management packs that enable core Service Manager features, such as incident management and change management.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
>  Unsealed management packs are not automatically upgraded during an upgrade to System Center 2012 - Service Manager.
