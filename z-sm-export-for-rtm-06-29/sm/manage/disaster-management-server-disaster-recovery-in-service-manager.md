# Management Server Disaster Recovery in Service Manager
This section describes how to recover a System Center 2012 - Service Manager management server or a data warehouse management server. If you installed additional Service Manager management servers, you have the option of promoting an additional Service Manager management server. Regardless of whether you encounter software or hardware failures of the Service Manager management server, your recovery process is based on restoring a computer that has the same computer name.  
  
 For either management server, your first step must be to restore the encryption key *before* you start the management server setup.
