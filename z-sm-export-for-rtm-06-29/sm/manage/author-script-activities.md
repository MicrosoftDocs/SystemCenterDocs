# Script Activities
Use a script activity in System Center 2012 - Service Manager to run a script as part of a workflow.  
  
 Script activities run as a separate process from the workflows; however, they also run under the security context of the Service Manager Workflow account.  
  
 The System Center 2016 - Service Manager Authoring Tool provides the following three default script activities in the **Generic Script Activities** subgroup of the **Script Activities** group in the **Activities Toolbox** pane.
