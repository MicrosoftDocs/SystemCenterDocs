# How to Edit a Change Request
In System Center 2012 - Service Manager, you can use the following procedures to edit a change request and then validate the edit. For example, you might want to change the priority of an existing change request from medium to high.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
>  You cannot delete an activity in a change request if the change request is in progress, however you can skip the activity or put the change request on hold and then delete the activity.  
  
### To edit a change request  
  
1.  In the Service Manager console, click **Work Items**.  
  
2.  In the **Work Items** pane, expand **Change Management**, and then click **All Change Requests**.  
  
3.  Double\-click a change request. For example, double\-click **Apply Exchange Server 2010 Service Pack 1**.  
  
4.  Make the change that you want. For example, if you want to change the priority to high, select **High** in the **Priority** list. Or, type new text in the **Description** box.  
  
5.  Click **OK** to update the change request and to close it.
