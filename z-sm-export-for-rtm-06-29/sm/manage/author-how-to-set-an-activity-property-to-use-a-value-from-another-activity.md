# How to Set an Activity Property to Use a Value from Another Activity
Use this procedure in the System Center 2016 - Service Manager Authoring Tool to configure an activity to obtain its property values from another activity in the workflow. This process is referred to as "binding" one property to another.  
  
### To set an activity property to use a value from another activity  
  
1.  In the authoring pane, click the activity you want. The **Details** pane becomes active, and it displays the properties for this activity.  
  
2.  Click the property you want to set, and then click the ellipsis \(**â€¦**\) button that appears for that property.  
  
3.  In the list of activities in the dialog box, expand the activity you want, and then select the property you want to use.  
  
4.  Click **OK** to close the dialog box.
