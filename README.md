##Code of conduct

This project has adopted the [Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/). For more information see the [Code of Conduct FAQ](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/faq/) or contact [opencode@microsoft.com](mailto:opencode@microsoft.com) with any additional questions or comments.


## Use GitHub, Git, and this repository

For information about how to contribute, how to use the GitHub UI to contribute small changes, and how to fork and clone the repository for more significant contributions, see [Install and set up tools for authoring in GitHub]().

If you install GitBash and choose to work locally, the steps for creating a new local working branch, making changes, and submitting the changes back to the main branch are listed in [Git commands for creating a new article or updating an existing article](./contributor-guide/git-commands-for-master.md)

### Branches

We recommend that you create local working branches that target a specific scope of change. Each branch should be limited to a single concept/article both to streamline work flow and reduce the possibility of merge conflicts.  The following efforts are of the appropriate scope for a new branch:

* A new article (and associated images)
* Spelling and grammar edits on an article.
* Applying a single formatting change across a large set of articles (e.g. new copyright footer).

## How to use markdown to format your topic

All the articles in this repository use GitHub flavored markdown.  Here's a list of resources.

## Article metadata

Article metadata enables certain functionalities on the technet.microsoft.com web site, such as author attribution, contributor attribution, breadcrumbs, article descriptions, and SEO optimizations as well as reporting Microsoft uses to evaluate the performance of the content. So, the metadata is important! [Here's the guidance for making sure your metadata is done right](./contributor-guide/article-metadata.md).
