# System requirements for System Center 2016 - XXX

The topic describes general performance and scalability guidance for System Center 2016 - XXX and recommends hardware configurations for a variety of workloads. Because System Center 2016 is built to be flexible and scalable, the hardware requirements for specific scenarios may differ from the guidelines that are presented here.  
<!---
This starter topic should be used as a template for creating System Requirements topics for a particular System Center component. The customer intent for this topic is for a System Administrator for System Center to be able to quickly determine whether they have all the required hardware and software for deploying either a standard or highly available System Center environment. You can add additional aections to the template if needed, and if a section requires more details you can add links to a separate topic to include those details. If a section in the teamplate does not apply to a component, it can be ommitted, however, if a section is inccluded, it should follow the guidance for subsection titles and format included in this template.
