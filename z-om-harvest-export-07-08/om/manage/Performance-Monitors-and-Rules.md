# Performance Monitors and Rules
Performance counters are numeric data that is used to measure the performance of some aspect of the application. Performance data usually comes from Windows performance counters but can also come from WMI and from scripts. Measuring and collecting performance data with scripts is covered in [Script Monitors and Rules](../../om/manage/Script-Monitors-and-Rules.md).  
  
## Performance Monitors and Rules Topics  
Details on each performance data source are provided in the following sections. This includes the information that is required to retrieve the required data, properties available in the resulting data, and what workflows the performance data source supports.  
  
-   [Performance Monitors](../../om/manage/Performance-Monitors.md)  
  
    Details on the different types of calculations that can be performed for performance monitors.  
  
-   [Windows Performance Collection Rules](../../om/manage/Windows-Performance-Collection-Rules.md)  
  
    Rules and monitors using Windows performance counters which are sampled at specified intervals.  
  
-   [WMI Performance](../../om/manage/WMI-Performance.md)  
  
    Rules and monitors that run a WMI query at specified interval and uses the value of a numeric property for performance data.  
  
-   [UNIX - Linux Shell Command Performance Collection Rules](../../om/manage/UNIX---Linux-Shell-Command-Performance-Collection-Rules.md)  
  
    Rules that execute a UNIX\/Linux command, script, or one\-line sequence of multiple commands \(using pipeline operators\) and collect the output as numerical performance data.
