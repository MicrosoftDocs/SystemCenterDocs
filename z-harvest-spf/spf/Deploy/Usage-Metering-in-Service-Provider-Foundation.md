As a hoster, Service Provider Foundation provides usage metering that enables you to:  
  
-   Obtain metrics for tenant usage consumption for virtual machines, CPU, memory, network, and disk.  
  
-   Determine capacity utilization.  
  
-   Bill tenants for their usage according their plans.  
  
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> Service Provider Foundation provides the Usage web service to be used only by [!INCLUDE[katal_1](../../orch/getstarted/includes/katal_1_md.md)] or by third party billing providers. The Usage web service endpoint should not be accessed for other purposes to prevent data loss due to unnecessary or erroneous queries.
