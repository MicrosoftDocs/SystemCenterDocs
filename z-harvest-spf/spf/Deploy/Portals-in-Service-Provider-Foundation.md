# Portals in Service Provider Foundation
[!INCLUDE[spflong](../../spf/Deploy/includes/spflong_md.md)] provides services for multiple tenants who receive IaaS through portal applications, and uniquely identifies each tenant and isolates them from one another. Portals communicate with the [!INCLUDE[spfshort](../../spf/Deploy/includes/spfshort_md.md)] Admin and [!INCLUDE[vmm12short](../../spf/Deploy/includes/vmm12short_md.md)] services through REST APIs as described in the [Service Provider Foundation Developer's Guide](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=263700).  
  
The following illustration shows how portal applications and Windows PowerShell interact with [!INCLUDE[spfshort](../../spf/Deploy/includes/spfshort_md.md)].
