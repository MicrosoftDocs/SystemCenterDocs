# Service Provider Foundation
[!INCLUDE[spflong](../../spf/Deploy/includes/spflong_md.md)] is provided with [!INCLUDE[orchlong](../../orch/deploy/includes/orchlong_md.md)], a component of [!INCLUDE[scr2](../../spf/Deploy/includes/scr2_md.md)] \(and [!INCLUDE[sc2012sp1_short](../../om/manage/includes/sc2012sp1_short_md.md)]\). [!INCLUDE[spfshort](../../spf/Deploy/includes/spfshort_md.md)] exposes an extensible OData web service that interacts with [!INCLUDE[vmm12sp1_long](../../spf/Deploy/includes/vmm12sp1_long_md.md)]. This enables service providers and hosters to design and implement multi\-tenant self\-service portals that integrate IaaS capabilities available on [!INCLUDE[scr2](../../spf/Deploy/includes/scr2_md.md)].  
  
The topics in this section pertain to both [!INCLUDE[scr2](../../spf/Deploy/includes/scr2_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[sc2012sp1_short](../../om/manage/includes/sc2012sp1_short_md.md)] unless otherwise indicated.
