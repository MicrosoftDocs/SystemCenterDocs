# About Runbooks in Service Manager
To automate processes in [!INCLUDE[sc2012]./Token/sc2012_md.md)],  [!INCLUDE[orchlong]./Token/orchlong_md.md)] uses runbooks to automate procedures. Runbooks are visual representations of the procedures. The value that runbooks have is that they help ensure that [!INCLUDE[orchshort]./Token/orchshort_md.md)] automation is driven and tracked from [!INCLUDE[smlong12]./Token/smlong12_md.md)] and that [!INCLUDE[smshort]./Token/smshort_md.md)] interactions with other  [!INCLUDE[sccore]./Token/sccore_md.md)] products and non\-Microsoft systems are much easier to implement.

Additionally, the [!INCLUDE[orchshort]./Token/orchshort_md.md)] workflow authoring interface is available for your custom [!INCLUDE[smshort]./Token/smshort_md.md)] scenarios. Runbooks are imported into [!INCLUDE[smshort]./Token/smshort_md.md)] using the [!INCLUDE[orchshort]./Token/orchshort_md.md)] connector. After the connector is synchronized, imported runbooks appear in the **Library** workspace under the **Runbooks** node in the [!INCLUDE[smcons]./Token/smcons_md.md)], where you can view them and also create runbook automation activity templates.

## About [!INCLUDE[orchlong]./Token/orchlong_md.md)]
[!INCLUDE[orchlong]./Token/orchlong_md.md)] is an automation platform for orchestrating and integrating IT tools to drive down the cost of datacenter operations, while improving the reliability of IT processes. [!INCLUDE[orchshort]./Token/orchshort_md.md)] enables IT organizations to automate best practices, such as those that are found in the Microsoft Operations Framework \(MOF\) and Information Technology Infrastructure Library \(ITIL\). This is achieved through workflow processes that coordinate [!INCLUDE[sccore]./Token/sccore_md.md)] and other management tools to automate incident response, change and compliance, and service\-life\-cycle management processes.

Through its workflow designer, [!INCLUDE[orchshort]./Token/orchshort_md.md)] automatically shares data and initiates tasks in [!INCLUDE[sc2012]./Token/sc2012_md.md)] components, including [!INCLUDE[om12short]./Token/om12short_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[smshort]./Token/smshort_md.md)], Virtual Machine Manager, System Center 2012 \- Configuration Manager, Active Directory Domain Services \(AD DS\), and non\-Microsoft tools. [!INCLUDE[orchshort]./Token/orchshort_md.md)] workflow automates IT infrastructure tasks, while  [!INCLUDE[smshort]./Token/smshort_md.md)] workflow provides automation of human workflow. The combined offering ensures repeatable, consistent results by removing the latency associated with manual coordination service delivery. [!INCLUDE[sccore]./Token/sccore_md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[orchshort]./Token/orchshort_md.md)] enable integration, efficiency, and business alignment of datacenter IT services by:

-   Automating processes and enforcing best practices for incident, change, and service\-life\-cycle management.

-   Reducing unanticipated errors and service delivery time by automating tasks across responsibility groups within your IT organization.

-   Integrating System Center with non\-Microsoft tools to enable interoperability across the datacenter.

-   Orchestrating tasks across systems for consistent, documented, and compliant activity.
