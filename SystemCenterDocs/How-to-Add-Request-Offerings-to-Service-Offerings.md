# How to Add Request Offerings to Service Offerings
Service offerings are logical groups of request offerings. For a service offering to appear in the [!INCLUDE[smssp](./Token/smssp_md.md)], each service offering must have at least one request offering added to it. After a service offering and a request offering are published, it is a straightforward process to associate them as a collection.

### To add request offerings to service offerings

1.  In the [!INCLUDE[smcons](./Token/smcons_md.md)], select **Library**.

2.  In the **Library** pane, expand **Service Catalog**, and then select **Published Request Offerings**.

3.  In the **Published Request Offerings** list, select one or more request offerings, and in the **Tasks** pane under **\<RequestOfferingName\>**, click **Add to Service Offering**.

4.  In the **Select objects** dialog box, select the service offering that you want to associate the request offering with, click **Add**, and then click **OK** to close the dialog box.
