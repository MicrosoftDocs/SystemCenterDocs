# Managing Incidents_Retired
The procedures in this section describe how to manage incidents by using [!INCLUDE[scsm_threshold_1](./Token/scsm_threshold_1_md.md)].

For a detailed description of the complete scenarios for managing incidents and problems, see [Sample Scenarios: Managing Incidents and Problems](./Sample-Scenarios--Managing-Incidents-and-Problems.md).

Help desk analysts use incident management to restore regular operations as quickly and as cost\-effectively as possible by creating new incidents. They also work in partnership with [!INCLUDE[smshort12](./Token/smshort12_md.md)] administrators to ensure that incidents that are created automatically or by end users are correctly categorized and reassigned to appropriate personnel. Methods that analysts use to accomplish these duties include:

-   Using the E\-mail Incident template to create new incidents.

-   Reviewing automatically created incidents, such as those incidents that are automatically created from System Center Operations ManagerÂ 2007 using the Operations Manager Alert connector.

-   Reviewing and updating incidents that are created by end users who have sent requests by email.

-   Combining incidents into parent\-child relationships when incidents are related.

To manage an incident, complete the steps in the following table.
