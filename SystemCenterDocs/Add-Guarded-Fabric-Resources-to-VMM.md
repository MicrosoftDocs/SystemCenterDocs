# Add Guarded Fabric Resources to VMM
Windows Sever 2016 introduces two new features: Shielded Virtual Machines and the Host Guardian Service. Combined these features protect virtual machines from malicious administrators, malware, and other attack vectors. With System Center 2016 - Virtual Maching Manager you can manage shielded VMs in your datacenter or private cloud and add a Guarded host to your VMM managed environment.
