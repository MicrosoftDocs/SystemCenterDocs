# How to Enable the Connectors in the Lab Environment
Use the following procedure to enable the [!INCLUDE[smshort](./Token/smshort_md.md)] connectors in the lab environment. In this procedure, you will not be enabling the Operations Manager connector.

> [!WARNING]
> Do not enable or delete the Operations Manager alert connector in the lab environment. Doing so will cause the alert connector in the production environment to fail.

### To enable a connector

1.  In the Service Manager console, click **Administration**.

2.  In the **Administration** pane, expand **Administration**, and then click **Connectors**.

3.  In the **Connectors** pane, select the connector that you want to enable.

4.  In the **Tasks** pane, under the connector name, click **Enable**.
