# Deploying Scale-Out File Servers from bare metal with VMM
The procedures in this section describe how to use [!INCLUDE[vmm12sp1_long](../Token/vmm12sp1_long_md.md)] to discover physical computers on the network, automatically install an operating system, and provision the computers into a Scale\-Out File Server.

For information about other approaches to deploying a Scale\-Out File Server, see [Managing Scale-Out File Servers with VMM](../Topic/Managing-Scale-Out-File-Servers-with-VMM.md).
