# System Center Windows Azure Pack Technologies
Windows Azure Pack for Windows Server is a collection of Windows Azure technologies, available to Microsoft customers at no additional cost for installation into your data center. It runs on top of Windows Server 2012 R2 and System Center 2012 R2 and, through the use of the Windows Azure technologies, enables you to offer a rich, self\-service, multi\-tenant cloud, consistent with the public Windows Azure experience. The main System Center technologies that support Windows Azure Pack are Virtual Machine Manager, Service Management Automation, and the Service Provider Foundation.
