# Overview of System Center release options 

System Center customers have their choice of release options: the Long-Term Servicing Channel (LTSC) or the new Semi-Annual Channel. The new Semi-Annual Channel is only offered for customers with Software Assurance. The Semi-Annual Channel aligns with the Windows Server release and servicing model announced in June 2017.

As a System Center customer, you can remain on the Long-Term Servicing Channel (LTSC) or move to the new Semi-Annual Channel. Choose the one that works best for your business and move to a different release channel when your requirements change.

## Long-Term Servicing Channel (LTSC)

LTSC is the release model you're already familiar with (formerly called the Long-Term Servicing Branch), where the System Center team releases a major version approximately every two to three years. LTSC provides five years of mainstream support and five additional years of extended support. This channel is appropriate for systems requiring a longer servicing option and functional stability.

In the LTSC, the System Center team releases security and non-security updates through Update Releases (UR). Update Releases, which are delivered through the LTSC, do not contain the new features or functionality released in the Semi-Annual Channel. 

Most features introduced in the Semi-Annual Channel will be rolled into the next Long-Term Servicing Channel release. Actual functionality varies by release depending on customer feedback.

## Semi-Annual Channel

The Semi-Annual Channel is perfect for customers who are quickly innovating to take advantage of new features and enhancements. Semi-Annual Channel releases occur approximately two times a year, and each release is called a version.

System Center, version 1801, was the first release in the Semi-Annual Channel. Versions are named according to the year and month of release. Semi-Annual Channel releases have an 18-month support policy from public availability (which is usually the same month or month following Engineering availability).  For example, System Center, version 1801, was available in January of 2018 and publicly released on February 8, 2018. [Support is available until August 8, 2019](sac-support-lifecycle.md), 18-months after official public release on February 8.

The Semi-Annual Channel is only offered to customers with Software Assurance. This channel, with its more frequent release cycle, will not have Update Releases (UR).

## Should you use LTSC or Semi-Annual Channel?

The key differences to consider:  

- Need to innovate rapidly? Do you need early access to the newest System Center features? If so, consider joining the **Semi-Annual Channel** by installing System Center, version 1801. As previously described, you receive new versions approximately two times a year, with 18 months of production support per release.
- Need predictability? If so, consider staying on the **Long-Term Servicing Channel**. The current LTSC release is System Center 2016. As previously noted, you have access to new versions approximately every two to three years. Each release comes with five years of mainstream support followed by five more years of extended support. LTSC releases are available to everyone, regardless of their licensing model.

## Compatibility

Unless otherwise communicated, the minimum requirements to run the System Center Semi-Annual Channel releases are the same as the most recent System Center Long-Term Servicing Channel release.

## Upgrade options

Customers with Software Assurance can upgrade from System Center 2016 or 2012R2 to System Center, version 1801. Upgrading from Semi-Annual Channel to LTSC releases is not supported.

## Servicing

The Long-Term Servicing Channel receives update releases containing security updates and non-security updates. The Semi-Annual Channel, with its more frequent release cycle, does not receive update releases.
