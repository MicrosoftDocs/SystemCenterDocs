# .NET Application Performance Monitoring Template_1
The **.NET Application Performance Monitoring** \(APM\) template in [!INCLUDE[om12long](Token/om12long_md.md)] lets you monitor Internet Information Services \(IIS\)\-hosted .NET applications from server\- and client\-side perspectives to get details about application performance and reliability that can help you pinpoint root causes of incidents. \([!INCLUDE[sc2012sp1note](Token/sc2012sp1note_md.md)] You can also monitor Windows Services.\) When you specify settings, the types of events to collect, the performance goals to measure, and servers to monitor, .NET Application Performance Monitoring reveals how applications are running. You can see how frequently a problem is occurring, how a server was performing when a problem occurred, and the chain of events related to the slow request or method that is raising exceptions. This information is required to partner with software developers and database administrators to help ensure that applications perform correctly and reliably for your customers.

This template lets you monitor applications and web services that are hosted in Internet Information Services \(IIS\) 7.0. You can select one or more applications or services discovered by the IIS 7.0 management pack and configure monitoring of performance and exception events. You must have the Windows Server 2008 Internet Information Services \(IIS\) 7.0 management pack installed to monitor applications and web services.

For [!INCLUDE[sc2012sp1_short](Token/sc2012sp1_short_md.md)], you can use the template to monitor applications and web services that are hosted in Internet Information Services \(IIS\) 8.0. You can select one or more applications or services discovered by the IIS 8.0 management pack and configure monitoring of performance and exception events. You must have the Windows Server 2012 Internet Information Services \(IIS\) 8.0 management pack installed to monitor applications and web services.

## <a name="BKMK_scenarios"></a>Scenarios
Use the **.NET Application Performance Monitoring** template in scenarios where you have to monitor web\-based applications. These scenarios include the following monitoring processes:

### Server\-Side Monitoring: Single\- or Multi\-Tier Web Applications
You might have applications that must be running at all times. Use the **.NET Application Performance Monitoring** template to ensure that your applications are reliable, have no exceptions, and meet service level agreements \(SLAs\), in short, that they perform correctly on the computers where they are installed.

### Client\-Side Monitoring: Browser Performance and Reliability
You want to ensure that your customers are having quality web experiences. By creating or editing existing templates, you can extend your server\-side monitoring by adding client\-side monitoring that measures the browser experience of your customers.

## <a name="BKMK_monitors"></a>Monitoring Performed by the .NET Application Performance Monitoring Template
By default, the **.NET Application Performance Monitoring** template configures the following monitoring. You can be enable, disable, and modify monitors in the **Advanced Configuration** page of the **.NET Application Performance Monitoring** template.

|Monitor description|Default values|
|-----------------------|------------------|
|Percentage of exception events per monitored requests|Enabled, Threshold\=15%, Interval\=5 minutes|
|Percentage of performance events per monitored requests|Enabled, Threshold\=20%, Interval\=5 minutes|
|Average Request Time|Enabled, Threshold\=10,000 ms, Interval\=5 minutes|

## <a name="BKMK_viewmonitordata"></a>Viewing Monitoring Data
All data collected by the **.NET Application Performance Monitoring** template appears in the **.NET Monitoring** folder in the **Application Monitoring** folder in the **Monitoring** navigation pane. For each of the application groups that you create by using the **.NET Application Performance Monitoring** template, the template creates a folder under **.NET Monitoring**. The **Application Monitoring** folder contains the default views and subfolders that provide health state, Performance views, and alerts related to the application components in the application group. By using the top\-level Application Group State view, you can see the health of the individual components and the monitoring configurations that have been enabled. The state of each object matches the state of the targeted object that has the worst health state so that you see the worst state of the monitors that are running. If one or more of the components are shown with an error while at least one other component is healthy, it could indicate a problem with that particular component, such as a credential issue. If all of the components are unhealthy, it could indicate a problem with the infrastructure, such as network connectivity issues.

**Application Monitoring folders**

To view the state of the individual monitors, open the Health Explorer for each component. Drill down to the unhealthy monitors to see what is making your application unhealthy. For more information, see [Monitoring .NET Applications](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=225673)

## <a name="BKMK_WizOpt"></a>Wizard Options
When you run the **.NET Application Performance Monitoring** template, you have to provide values for options as listed in the following tables. Each table represents a single page in the wizard.

### <a name="BKMK_genprop"></a>General Properties
![](Image/AppMonitoring_AuthTemp1GeneralProperties.gif)

The following options are available on the **General Properties** page of the wizard.

|Option|Description|
|----------|---------------|
|Name|Enter the friendly name used for the template and application group that you are creating. This name is displayed in the Operations console and used for the folder under the **.NET Monitoring** folder. **Note:** After you have given the template a name and saved the template, this name cannot be edited without deleting and re\-creating the template instance.|
|Description|Describe the application group. \(Optional\)|
|Select destination management pack|Select the management pack to store the views and configuration created by the template. Use the same name for your new management pack as the application group so you can easily pair the two names. You can use an existing management pack or create a new management pack.<br /><br />For more information about management packs, see [Selecting a Management Pack File](Selecting-a-Management-Pack-File.md).|

### <a name="BKMK_whatmonitor"></a>What to Monitor
![](Image/AppMonitoring_AuthTemp2What_to_Monitor.gif)

The following options are available on the **What to Monitor** page of the wizard.

|Option|Description|
|----------|---------------|
|Application components, Add|Search for and add or remove the application components to monitor.<br /><br />When you click **Add**, the Object Search page opens, which lets you select whether you want to monitor Web Applications and Services. [!INCLUDE[sc2012sp1note](Token/sc2012sp1note_md.md)] You can monitor Windows Services. **Note:** [!INCLUDE[sc2012sp1note](Token/sc2012sp1note_md.md)] Before you begin monitoring Windows Services, you need to configure Windows Services using the Windows Service template. Once you do this, the.NET Application Performance Monitoring template can discover the Windows Services that are running. For more information, see [Authoring the Windows Service Template](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=252385).|
|Environment|Select the environment in which you want to monitor your application: **None**, **Production**, **Staging**, **Test**, **Development**, or use **New** to create a new tag. Typically, you want to pair the environment tag with the server group that you are monitoring. The tag is appended to the application group name and component names, letting you differentiate the event data in Application Diagnostics and Application Advisor. From a monitoring perspective, the environment tag lets you separate the same application into multiple virtual applications. **Note:** After you have selected an environment tag and saved the template, the tag cannot be edited without deleting and re\-creating the template instance.|
|Targeted group|Select specific servers to limit monitoring to this specific set of servers. This is optional.<br /><br />Targeted group scoping only becomes necessary when you have the same application running in multiple environments, such as production and staging, and you intend to run the template multiple times, one for each environment. In this scenario, group which machines belong to production and which belong to the staging environment, and then use the targeted groups to restrict where the configuration is propagated. You can also use groups to apply configuration to a subset of your servers. Otherwise, it is not necessary to specify targeted group scoping if you just want to monitor all instances of a given application.|

### Object Search
![](Image/AppMonitoring_SP1CTP2_ObjectSearchPage.gif)

|Performance event threshold \(ms\)|Set the threshold in milliseconds \(ms\) that a user transaction must exceed before it raises a performance event. **Note:** The application component continues to monitor the page specified in the transaction by using the performance threshold that is set for the application component. This threshold is used as a second measure on the same page in the application component. If you set this threshold higher than the application component threshold, you get a single event, but you might get two performance alerts for the transaction when the threshold is breached—one from the application component and one from the transaction, depending on your alerting settings. Transactions are typically used to monitor the individual page more aggressively than the parent application, at a lower threshold, or to monitor a page where alerting has been disabled on the parent.|
|Sensitivity threshold \(ms\)|Specify to filter out fast\-running methods to reduce overall “noise” by reducing the size of the call stack by gathering less data for each event. An event is still generated if the threshold is surpassed. For more information, see [Authoring Strategies for .NET Application Monitoring](Authoring-Strategies-for-.NET-Application-Monitoring.md)|
