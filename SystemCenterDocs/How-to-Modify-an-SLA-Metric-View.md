# How to Modify an SLA Metric View
You can use the following procedures to customize an SLA view.

Views let you group SLA metrics that share certain criteria. However, when you personalize changes to a view, those changes are not saved. For example, you can customize the **Metrics** view, but if you change column widths, column sorting, grouping, or if you remove columns, the next time you return to the view it displays information in the same manner as it did before you personalized it.

### To personalize an SLA metric view

1.  In the [!INCLUDE[smcons](./Token/smcons_md.md)], click **Administration**.

2.  In the **Administration** pane, expand **Service Level Management**, and then select **Metric**.

3.  Right\-click any view column heading to resize columns, to remove items from the results, or to change column sorting and grouping. Repeat this step until you are satisfied with the results.

4.  You can also type in the **Filter** box to show results that are limited items that match what you typed.
