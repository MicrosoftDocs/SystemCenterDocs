> If you are planning to upgrade two or more System Center components, it is imperative that you first consult the guide [Upgrade Sequencing for System Center 2012 SP1](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=268417). The order in which you perform component upgrades is important. Failure to follow the correct upgrade sequence might result in component failure for which no recovery options exist. The affected System Center components are:
> 
> 1.  [!INCLUDE[orchshort](Token/orchshort_md.md)]
> 2.  [!INCLUDE[smshort12](Token/smshort12_md.md)]
> 3.  [!INCLUDE[dpm2012sp1long](Token/dpm2012sp1long_md.md)]
> 4.  [!INCLUDE[om12short](Token/om12short_md.md)]
> 5.  [!INCLUDE[cmshort](Token/cmshort_md.md)]
> 6.  [!INCLUDE[vmm12sp1_med](Token/vmm12sp1_med_md.md)]
> 7.  [!INCLUDE[conceroshort](Token/conceroshort_md.md)]
