# Authoring Automation Runbooks_1
Runbooks in [!INCLUDE[sma_1](../Token/sma_1_md.md)] and Microsoft Azure Automation are Windows PowerShell workflows. They provide the ability to automate administrative processes for managing and deploying cloud servers or any other function that a Windows PowerShell script can perform.

There is no difference in the runbooks between the two systems, and the same runbook can run on either with identical functionality. When the term *Automation* is used in this guide, it refers to both [!INCLUDE[sma_1](../Token/sma_1_md.md)] and Microsoft Azure Automation.

The additional services provided by Automation for working with Windows PowerShell Workflows include the following:

-   Centralized storage and management of runbooks.

-   Scalable architecture for scheduling and running runbooks.

-   Global resources that are centrally managed and available to all runbooks.

-   User interface for authoring and testing runbooks.

-   Set of cmdlets for managing and starting runbooks.
