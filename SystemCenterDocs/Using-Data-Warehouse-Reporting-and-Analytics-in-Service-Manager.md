# Using Data Warehouse Reporting and Analytics in Service Manager
[!INCLUDE[smshort](Token/smshort_md.md)] reports enable you to collect and view data and trends from across the business environment. For example, you can generate a report that shows the number of incidents that occur in a specific time frame. You can then use that information to calculate the cost of each incident \(in hours\) and also to identify any trends and take preventative measures to reduce the cost and occurrence of incidences.

Standard reports are viewable for all [!INCLUDE[smcons](Token/smcons_md.md)] users in the Reporting workspace. If users can view work items and have permission to the SystemCenter and ServiceManager folders on the SQLÂ Server Reporting Services \(SSRS\) server, they can also view reports in work item task lists. Any user can export report data from a report they view. Exported reports are saved in a variety of file formats.

Besides standard reports, reporting data is also presented through Service Manager by using predefined and customized Microsoft Online Analytical Processing \(OLAP\) data cubes. In short, advanced analytics in Service Manager consist of publishing, viewing, and manipulating cube data, usually in either Microsoft Excel or Microsoft SharePoint. Excel is primarily used by itself to view and manipulate data. SharePoint is used primarily as a means of publishing and sharing cube data.
