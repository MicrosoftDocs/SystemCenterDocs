# Creating profiles and templates in VMM
[!INCLUDE[vmm12sp1_long](Token/vmm12sp1_long_md.md)] profiles contain configuration settings that you can apply to a new virtual machine template or virtual machine. You can create, view, and modify profiles in the **Library** workspace. The following topics provide information about how to create profiles and virtual machine templates:

-   [Overview: creating profiles and templates in VMM](Overview--creating-profiles-and-templates-in-VMM.md)

-   [How to create a hardware profile](How-to-create-a-hardware-profile.md)

-   [How to create a guest operating system profile](How-to-create-a-guest-operating-system-profile.md)

-   [How to create an application profile in a service deployment](How-to-create-an-application-profile-in-a-service-deployment.md)

-   [How to create a SQL Server profile in a service deployment](How-to-create-a-SQL-Server-profile-in-a-service-deployment.md)

-   [How to create a virtual machine template](How-to-create-a-virtual-machine-template.md)

> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE[vmm12short](Token/vmm12short_md.md)] also includes physical computer profiles. These profiles are not used for virtual machine creation. They are used for provisioning Hyper\-V hosts, host clusters, or Scale\-Out File Server clusters from bare metal.
