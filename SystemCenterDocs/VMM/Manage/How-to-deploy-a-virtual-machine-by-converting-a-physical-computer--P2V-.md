# How to deploy a virtual machine by converting a physical computer (P2V)
In [!INCLUDE[vmm12short](../../Token/vmm12short_md.md)] in [!INCLUDE[sc_threshold_1](../../Token/sc_threshold_1_md.md)], you can't perform P2V conversions. Instead, use the Microsoft Virtual Machine Converter \(MVMC\). For more information, see [Microsoft Virtual Machine Converter 3.0](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn873998.aspx).
