# Using infrastructure servers in VMM
You can add infrastructure servers to [!INCLUDE[vmm12sp1_long](Token/vmm12sp1_long_md.md)], that is, servers that support services such as Active Directory, DNS, DHCP, Operations Manager, Service Manager, and so on. In [!INCLUDE[vmm12short](Token/vmm12short_md.md)], these servers are listed under the role of **Infrastructure**. Adding infrastructure servers can make it easier to keep them updated.

> [!NOTE]
> All infrastructure servers in [!INCLUDE[vmm12short](Token/vmm12short_md.md)] must run [!INCLUDE[winblue_server_2](Token/winblue_server_2_md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[winthreshold_server_2](Token/winthreshold_server_2_md.md)].

You can perform the following procedures on infrastructure servers:

-   Create baselines for infrastructure nodes using existing [!INCLUDE[vmm12short](Token/vmm12short_md.md)] baseline tools and processes.

-   Apply baselines to all infrastructure nodes once they are added as managed computers.

-   View compliance status of infrastructure nodes after baselines have been applied.

-   Orchestrate remediation to the infrastructure nodes using existing baseline tools and procedures.

## In This Section
Follow these procedures to when using infrastructure servers in [!INCLUDE[vmm12short](Token/vmm12short_md.md)].
