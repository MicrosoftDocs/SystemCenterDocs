# Integrating VMM and System Center Operations Manager
You can connect [!INCLUDE[vmm12sp1_long](../../Token/vmm12sp1_long_md.md)] with Operations Manager to monitor the health and availability of the virtual machines and virtual machine hosts that [!INCLUDE[vmm12short](../../Token/vmm12short_md.md)] manages. You can also monitor health and availability of the VMM management server, the VMM database server, and library servers, and see diagram views of the virtualized environment through the Operations console in Operations Manager.

For information about the versions of Operations Manager that [!INCLUDE[vmm12short](../../Token/vmm12short_md.md)] supports, see [Preparing your environment for System Center 2016 - Virtual Machine Manager](../Deploy/Preparing-your-environment-for-System-Center-2016---Virtual-Machine-Manager.md).

When you integrate [!INCLUDE[vmm12short](../../Token/vmm12short_md.md)] with [!INCLUDE[om12short](../../Token/om12short_md.md)], the monitoring pack for [!INCLUDE[vmm12short](../../Token/vmm12short_md.md)] is automatically imported into [!INCLUDE[om12short](../../Token/om12short_md.md)], and in addition, the following features become available:

-   Performance and Resource Optimization \(PRO\)

-   Maintenance Mode integration

-   Support for SQL Server Analysis Services \(SSAS\) and the reporting capabilities provided by SSAS

The following topics provide information about how to integrate [!INCLUDE[vmm12short](../../Token/vmm12short_md.md)] with Operations Manager:
