# How to install a WSUS server for VMM
To manage updates in [!INCLUDE[vmm12sp1_long](../../Token/vmm12sp1_long_md.md)], you must either set up a dedicated Windows Server Update Services \(WSUS\) server or use an existing WSUS server.

> [!NOTE]
> To use an existing WSUS server that is deployed in a System Center Configuration Manager environment, see [How to integrate fabric updates with Configuration Manager](How-to-integrate-fabric-updates-with-Configuration-Manager.md).

This topic covers either a local or remote WSUS server without Secure Sockets Layer \(SSL\).

### To install the WSUS server role for [!INCLUDE[vmm12short](../../Token/vmm12short_md.md)]

1.  Decide whether to install WSUS on the [!INCLUDE[vmm12short](../../Token/vmm12short_md.md)] management server or on a remote server. The WSUS server can be running [!INCLUDE[winthreshold_server_2](../../Token/winthreshold_server_2_md.md)] or [!INCLUDE[winblue_server_2](../../Token/winblue_server_2_md.md)].

    We recommend setting up a remote WSUS server, especially if the [!INCLUDE[vmm12short](../../Token/vmm12short_md.md)] management server is managing a large number of computers. We also recommend that you set up a remote WSUS server if you are using a highly available [!INCLUDE[vmm12short](../../Token/vmm12short_md.md)] management server.

2.  Install the WSUS server role on the chosen server. Windows automatically selects any other server roles that are required such as Internet Information Services \(IIS\).

    For more information, see[Install the WSUS Server Role](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/hh852338.aspx).

3.  If you set up WSUS on a remote server, install a WSUS Administration Console on the [!INCLUDE[vmm12short](../../Token/vmm12short_md.md)] management server and then restart the [!INCLUDE[vmm12short](../../Token/vmm12short_md.md)] service. If you have a highly available [!INCLUDE[vmm12short](../../Token/vmm12short_md.md)] management server, on each node of the cluster, install a WSUS Administration Console and then restart the [!INCLUDE[vmm12short](../../Token/vmm12short_md.md)] service.

    Update management in [!INCLUDE[vmm12short](../../Token/vmm12short_md.md)] requires a WSUS Administration Console, which includes the respective WSUSÂ Class Library Reference.
