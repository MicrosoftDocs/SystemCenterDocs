      <para>You can configure the driver packages to be deployed to clients in three ways. The following table describes each of these methods and describes when you should use each.</para>

            </TD>
            <TD>
              <para>In this scenario, you make all packages available to all clients (that is, you do not add filters to your driver groups), and you configure the groups so that only those packages that match the hardware on the computer will be installed. </para>
            </TD>
            <TD>
              <para>This is the simplest scenario to configure, and most companies should try this scenario first. However, if you encounter problems because incompatible packages are installed simultaneously on a computer (for example, if you have computers that cannot boot, or hardware that does not work correctly), then you will need to add filters to your driver groups as defined in Scenario 2.</para>

            <TD>
              <para>In this scenario, you organize your packages into driver groups, and then map each group to computers using filters. The filters define which computers have access to the driver group based on the hardware of the computer and/or the attributes of the selected install image. You can still configure the packages to be installed based on Plug and Play hardware, but you can use the filters to further define which clients will have access to the packages.</para>

    <title>Scenario 2: Deploy Drivers Using Filters to Define Which Clients Have Access to Each Driver Group</title>

      <para>This scenario is not as simple as Scenario 1 in that it will require you to test your configuration until the filters are configured appropriately for your environment. You may need to create many driver groups with different filter combinations before you find a configuration that works for you. In general, the more complex your environment is, the more complex your configuration will need to be. </para>

The two available operators for most filters are <system>Equal to</system> or <system>Not equal to</system>. Therefore, if the value you specify is one character off (for example, if you omit a period) the filters will not filter the clients as intended. For this reason, we recommend that you create multiple filters to account for all cases.

        <content>
          <para>The first step in this scenario is to create driver groups that have filters. The filters define which computers should have access to the driver packages in that group. You can configure packages to be installed based on the hardware of the client (for example, the manufacturer or BIOS vendor) and the attributes of the Windows image that is selected during the installation (for example, the version or edition). For example, you could specify that the only client computers that should have access to a group are those that 1) are manufactured by Fabrikam, Inc. and 2) select a WindowsÂ 8 image during the installation. Once you have your driver groups configured, you will add packages to them, and then you will be ready to boot a computer and install an operating system. </para>
