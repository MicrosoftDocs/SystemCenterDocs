# How to View a Runbook
After you import runbooks from [!INCLUDE[orchlong](../Token/orchlong_md.md)] into [!INCLUDE[smlong12](../Token/smlong12_md.md)], you can open the runbook in the [!INCLUDE[smcons](../Token/smcons_md.md)] to ensure that it contains the parameters you want to use in an automation activity template in [!INCLUDE[smshort](../Token/smshort_md.md)].

> [!NOTE]
> This procedure requires Windows Internet Explorer with Microsoft Silverlight installed.

When you view the runbook, you can perform basic actions with the runbook, such as viewing the summary, jobs, instances, and definition of the runbook. You can also start and stop the runbook.

### To view a runbook

1.  In the [!INCLUDE[smcons](../Token/smcons_md.md)], select **Library**.

2.  In the **Library** pane, select **Runbooks**.

3.  In the **Runbooks** view, select a runbook.

4.  In the **Tasks** pane under **<RunbookName>**, click **View Runbooks** to open the runbook in Internet Explorer.
