# Set or change the Service Management Automation endpoint
The **QuickStart** tab for [!INCLUDE[sma_2](../../Token/sma_2_md.md)] in [!INCLUDE[katal_1](../../Token/katal_1_md.md)] provides a link that enables you to set up or change the [!INCLUDE[sma_1](../../Token/sma_1_md.md)] endpoint. If the [!INCLUDE[sma_1](../../Token/sma_1_md.md)] endpoint is not yet registered, click **Register the Service Management Automation endpoint** to configure it. To change the [!INCLUDE[sma_1](../../Token/sma_1_md.md)] endpoint settings after an endpoint has been set up, click **Current Service Management Automation endpoint**.

The [!INCLUDE[sma_1](../../Token/sma_1_md.md)] endpoint requires the following information:

-   The service URL and port. The port number is set when you install [!INCLUDE[sma_1](../../Token/sma_1_md.md)].

-   The user name of a user account that can access the [!INCLUDE[sma_1](../../Token/sma_1_md.md)] web service. Accounts with access to the [!INCLUDE[sma_1](../../Token/sma_1_md.md)] web service are also set during installation.

-   The access password for the user account.
