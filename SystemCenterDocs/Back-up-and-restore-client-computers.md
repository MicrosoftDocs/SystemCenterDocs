# Back up and restore client computers
DPM provides backup and recovery for your client computers.

You set up client protection as follows:

-   [Back up client computers with DPM](./Back-up-client-computers-with-DPM.md)—Read these before you begin deployment.

-   [Configure client computer protection](./Configure-client-computer-protection.md)—Set up protection groups to configure backup, and configure monitoring.

-   [Recover client computer data](./Recover-client-computer-data.md)

-   [Client auto\-deployment management pack \[TO DELETE\]](assetId:///9f2dbf63-961e-4da7-9992-590c008f8c98)—Learn about automated client deployment.
