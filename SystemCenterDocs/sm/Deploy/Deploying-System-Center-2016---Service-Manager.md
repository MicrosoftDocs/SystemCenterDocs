# Deploying System Center 2016 - Service Manager

>Applies To: System Center 2016 Technical Preview - Service Manager

This guide helps you deploy System Center 2016 Technical Preview - Service Manager in one of several different scenarios. The scenarios range from a simple, two-computer scenario to a four-computer scenario that is designed to support production-type environments. In addition, this guide shows you how to register a Service Manager management group with the Service Manager data warehouse so that you can generate reports. You have the option of deploying the Self-Service Portal so you can provide access to Service Manager through a web browser. To improve performance and provide for redundancy, you can deploy additional secondary Service Manager management servers.
