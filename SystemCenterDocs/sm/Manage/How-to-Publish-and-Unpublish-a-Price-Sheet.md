# How to Publish and Unpublish a Price Sheet

>Applies To: System Center 2016 Technical Preview - Service Manager

You must have created a price sheet and saved it before you can publish it. After you publish a price sheet, you can assign private cloud objects to the price sheet. For more information about publishing a price sheet, see [How to Create or Modify a Price Sheet](How-to-Create-or-Modify-a-Price-Sheet.md).

> [!NOTE]
> You can unpublish a price sheet only when it does not have cloud objects assigned to it or if a VMM cloud user role has not been assigned.
