# About Languages Supported by the Service Catalog
The Self-Service Portal in Service Manager supports many localized languages for service offerings. The following is a list of languages that are supported in Service Managerr. These languages are supported in the Service Manager console by means of the service offering **Language** item that you select. 

> [!NOTE]
> There is an exception for East Asian languages. Specifically, in the Service Manager console you must select **Chinese (Traditional, Taiwan)** and **Chinese (Simplified)** instead of the **Chinese (Traditional)** and **Chinese (Simplified, China)**.
