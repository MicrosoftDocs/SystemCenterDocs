# About Languages Supported by the Service Catalog
The [!INCLUDE[smssp](../../includes/smssp_md.md)] in Service Manager supports many localized languages for service offerings. The following is a list of languages that are supported in Service Managerr. These languages are supported in the [!INCLUDE[smcons](../../includes/smcons_md.md)] by means of the service offering **Language** item that you select. 

> [!NOTE]
> There is an exception for East Asian languages. Specifically, in the [!INCLUDE[smcons](../../includes/smcons_md.md)] you must select **Chinese \(Traditional, Taiwan\)** and **Chinese \(Simplified\)** instead of the **Chinese \(Traditional\)** and **Chinese \(Simplified, China\)**.
