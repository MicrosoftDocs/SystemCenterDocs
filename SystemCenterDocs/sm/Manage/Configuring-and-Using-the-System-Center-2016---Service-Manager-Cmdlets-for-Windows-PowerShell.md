# Configuring and Using the System Center 2016 - Service Manager Cmdlets for Windows PowerShell
This section provides an introduction to the Service Manager cmdlets for the Windows PowerShell command-line interface.

Before you can run any command in the Windows PowerShell command-line interface in Service Manager, you must set execution policy to RemoteSigned. Before you can run data warehouse cmdlets, you must manually import the data warehouse cmdlets module.

The Service Manager cmdlets are implemented in the following two modules:

-   **System.Center.Service.Manager**. This module is imported automatically every time a Service Manager Windows PowerShell session is opened.

-   **Microsoft.EnterpriseManagement.Warehouse.Cmdlets**. This module must be imported manually.
