# How to Delete a Service Offering or a Request Offering

>Applies To: System Center 2016 Technical Preview - Service Manager

Service offerings and their request offerings are available to Self-Service Portal users, when the status of the offering is set to Published and if end users have been assigned a corresponding Service Manager user role.
