# How to Disable and Enable a System Center Operations Manager Connector
You can use the following procedures to disable or enable a System Center Operations Manager connector for Service Manager and validate the changes.

For example, after you configure an Operations Manager connector, if you must perform maintenance operations on the [!INCLUDE[smshort](../../includes/smshort_md.md)] database, you can temporarily disable the connector and suspend the data import. You can resume the data import by re\-enabling the connector.

For more information about how to delete a product connector from System Center Operations Manager, see [Removing an Old Product Connector](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=188974) on Kevin Holmanâ€™s System Center blog.
