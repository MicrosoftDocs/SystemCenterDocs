# How to Edit SLA Metrics
In Service Manager, you edit a service level agreement (SLA) metric to update the title, start date, and end date. After you edit a metric, you associate it with a service level objective. If the metric is already associated with a service level objective, it appears in the **Related SLA(s)** area.

> [!NOTE]
> You should avoid making changes to an SLA metric that is in use because changing it might cause performance problems. If possible, edit in-use SLA metrics during a period of minimal system use, such during as a maintenance period.

### To edit an SLA metric

1.  In the Service Manager console, click **Administration**.

2.  In the **Administration** pane, expand **Service Level Management**, and then click **Metric**.

3.  In the **Metric** list, select an existing metric, and then in the **Tasks** pane, under **<MetricName\>**, click **Properties**.

4.  In the **Create/Edit Metric** dialog box, modify any of the following items, as needed:

    -   **Title**

    -   **Description**

    -   **Start date**

    -   **End date**

5.  Click **OK** to close the **Create/Edit Metric** dialog box.
