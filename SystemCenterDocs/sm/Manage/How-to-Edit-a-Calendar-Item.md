# How to Edit a Calendar Item

>Applies To: System Center 2016 Technical Preview - Service Manager

You edit a calendar item in Service Manager to update work days, work hours, and holidays. After you edit a calendar item, you will use it as part of a service level objective, where it is measured against a time metric. If the calendar is already associated with a service level objective, it appears in the **Related SLA(s)** area.

> [!NOTE]
> When you update an existing calendar item, the update is effective for incidents and service requests created afterward; however, the updates do not affect existing incidents.

### To edit a calendar item

1.  In the Service Manager console, click **Administration**.

2.  In the **Administration** pane, expand **Service Level Management**, and then click **Calendar**.

3.  In the Calendar list, select an existing calendar, and then in the **Tasks** pane, under **<CalendarName\>**, click **Properties**.

4.  In the **Create/Edit Calendar** dialog box, modify any of the following items, as needed:

    -   **Title**

    -   **Time zone**

    -   **Working days and hours**

    -   **Holidays**

5.  Click **OK** to close the **Create/Edit Calendar** dialog box.
