# How to Unpublish a Request Offering

>Applies To: System Center 2016 Technical Preview - Service Manager

When you unpublish a request offering, it is removed from the Self-Service Portal so that end users cannot request it. You can use the following procedure to unpublish a request offering.

### To unpublish a request offering

1.  In the Service Manager console, select **Library**.

2.  In the **Library** pane, expand **Service Catalog**, and then select **Published Request Offerings**.

3.  In the **Published Request Offerings** list, select one or more request offerings, and in the **Tasks** pane under **<RequestOfferingName\>**, click **Unpublish**.
