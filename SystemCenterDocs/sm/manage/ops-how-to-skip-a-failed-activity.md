# How to Skip a Failed Activity

>Applies To: System Center 2016 - Service Manager

The release manager skips a failed activity by performing the following procedure.  

### To skip a failed activity  

1.  In the Service Manager console, open the **Work Items** workspace, in the **Work Items** pane, expand **Release Management**, and then select **Release Management**.  

2.  In the **Work Items** pane, select a view under **Release Management** that displays a release record that includes a failed release activity or an activity in progress that you want to skip, and then double\-click the record to open it.  

3.  Click the **Activities** tab to view the list of proposed changes and dependent activities they contain. Optionally, you can change the activities view by clicking either **Diagram View** or **List View**.  

4.  Right\-click the failed activity or the activity in progress that you want to skip, and then click **Skip Activity**.  

5.  In the **Comments** box, enter the reason why you are skipping the activity, and then click **OK** to close the box. The activity that you skipped displays an icon resembling a blue down\-pointing arrow to indicate that the activity is marked as skipped.
