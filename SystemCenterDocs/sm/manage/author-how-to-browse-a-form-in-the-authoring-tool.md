# How to Browse a Form in the Authoring Tool

>Applies To: System Center 2016 - Service Manager

Use one of the following two procedures to browse a form in the Service Manager Authoring Tool. In both procedures, note that the properties in the **Details** pane are updated according to the class property that is bound to the selected control. And, note that the **Binding Path** entry in the **Details** pane indicates the respective property that the field in the form represents.  

### To browse a form from the Form Browser  

1.  If the **Form Browser** pane is not visible, click **View**, and then click the **Form Browser** tab.  

2.  In the **Form Browser** pane, select the management pack that contains the form that you want to view.

5.  Select a control on the form.

1.  In the Authoring Tool, click **File**, and then click **Open**.  

2.  In the **Open a Management Pack** dialog box, select the management pack that contains the form that you want to view. For example, select **Management Packs** as the file type, and then select the **ServiceManager.ChangeManagement.Library.mp** management pack in the D:\\Program Files \(x86\)\\Microsoft System Center\\Service Manager 2016 Authoring\\Library folder.
