# How to Plan Release Activities

>Applies To: System Center 2016 - Service Manager

The Release Manager creates and modifies the structure of release activities by performing the following procedure.  

### To plan release activities  

1.  In the Service Manager console, open the **Work Items** workspace, and in the **Work Items** pane, expand **Release Management**, and then select **Release Management**.  

2.  In the **Work Items** pane, select a view under **Release Management** that displays a release record that includes release activities that you want to add or modify activities for, and then double\-click the record to open it.  

3.  Click the **Activities** tab to view the list of proposed changes and dependent activities they contain.  

4.  Optionally, you can change the activities view by clicking either **Diagram View** or **List View**.  

5.  Select a dependent change management activity, and then move it to the top of release management activity list or diagram. A dependent indicator appears on release management activities, which resembles the link in a chain.
