# How to Add a Panel Control to a Form in the Authoring Tool

>Applies To: System Center 2016 - Service Manager

The **Panel** control in the Service Manager Authoring Tool is a **Layout** control that helps you manage a group of related controls. Typically, you drag and position several controls that have a related purpose on the form on a panel control. Then, if you need to move the controls that are on the panel, instead of moving each control individually, you can simply move the **Panel** control.  

 Use the following procedure to add a **Panel** control to a form.  

### To add a Panel control to a form  

1.  Ensure that the **Form Customization Toolbox** pane is open and that the form that you want to customize is open in the authoring pane.  

2.  Drag the **Panel** icon from the **Form Customization Toolbox** pane to the form. You can now add other controls on the **Panel** control.
