# Creating Workflows for IT Processes

>Applies To: System Center 2016 - Service Manager

To use a workflow to automate a process in the Service Manager Authoring Tool, you must define what the workflow should do, when it should run, and what information it needs. You can start with general definitions and then refine them until you have details that you can work with in Service Manager.
