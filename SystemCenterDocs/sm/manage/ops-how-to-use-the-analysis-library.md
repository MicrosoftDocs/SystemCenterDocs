# How to Use the Analysis Library

>Applies To: System Center 2016 - Service Manager

You can use the following procedure in Service Manager to view Microsoft Excel workbooks that connect to Microsoft Online Analytical Processing \(OLAP\) data cubes by using the **Analysis Library** node in the Reporting workspace. Workbooks are saved to the Analysis Library by Service Manager so that report users can easily access the workbooks.  

### To use the analysis library  

1.  In the Service Manager console, click **Reporting**, expand the **Analysis Library** node, and then navigate to the folder that contains an Excel workbook that you want to open.  

2.  Select the Excel workbook that you want to open, and then in the **Tasks** list, click **Open Excel File**.  

3.  In the Excel workbook, you can refresh the data from the data warehouse. For example, click the **Data** tab and then click **Refresh All** to update the workbook.
