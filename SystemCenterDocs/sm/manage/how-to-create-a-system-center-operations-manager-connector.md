# How to Create a System Center Operations Manager Connector

>Applies To: System Center 2016 Technical Preview - Service Manager

In Service Manager, there are two types of connectors for System Center Operations Manager. You use the first type of connector, the alert connector, to automatically generate incidents that are based on Operations Manager alerts. You use the second type of connector, the configuration item (CI) connector, to import discovered objects from Operations Manager as configuration items into the Service Manager database. You can use the following procedures to create both connectors, validate them, and confirm their creation.

> [!NOTE]
> For the Operations Manager CI connector to function correctly, you have to import a set of management packs into Service Manager. For more information, see[How to Import Management Packs for System Center Operations Manager Configuration Item Connectors](How-to-Import-Management-Packs-for-System-Center-Operations-Manager-Configuration-Item-Connectors.md).

Alerts that are generated by Operations Manager and that are sent to Service Manager do not contain user information. Therefore, when you open an incident in Service Manager, the **Affected User** box will be empty. You will not be able to save the incident form until you select an affected user. We recommend that you create a special user in Service Manager specifically for this purpose. For more information about how to create a special user, see [How to Manually Create Configuration Items](How-to-Manually-Create-Configuration-Items.md). This user is the user that you will assign to the **Affected User** field for all incidents created by Operations Manager.

You have the option of defining Service Manager templates that run when alerts of certain types are received. If you decide to add an alert routing rule, you can configure Service Manager to use a particular template based on alert criteria such, as priority or severity, as described in the following procedure.

There are two phases for creating the Alert connector. The first part involves creating the Alert connector on the Service Manager management server. The second part requires that you start the Operations Manager console and set up a subscription for the newly created connector. The subscription you create must be unique for the Alert connector; no connector that is created to point to Operations Manager should have a subscription that overlaps with another Operations Manager internal connector. Both phases are described in the following procedure.

### To create an Operations Manager alert connector

1.  In the Service Manager console, click **Administration**.

2.  In the **Administration** pane, expand **Administration**, and then click **Connectors**.

3.  In the **Tasks** pane, under **Connectors**, click **Create Connector**, and then click **Operations Manager Alert Connector**.

4.  Complete the following steps to complete the Operations Manager Alert Connector Wizard:

    1.  On the **Before You Begin** page, click **Next**.

    2.  On the **General** page, in the **Name** box, type a name for the new connector. Make sure that the **Enable** check box is selected, and then click **Next**. Make a note of this name; you will need this name in step 7 of this procedure.

    3.  On the **Server Details** page, in the **Server name** box, type the name of the server that is hosting the Operations Manager root management server. Under **Credentials**, click **New**.

    4.  In the **Run As Account** dialog box, in the **Display name** box, type a name for this Run As account. In the **Account** list, select **Windows Account**.

    5.  In the **User Name**, **Password**, and **Domain** fields, type the credentials for the Run As account, and then click **OK**.

    6.  On the **Server Details** page, click **Test Connection**. If you receive the following confirmation message, click **OK**, and then click **Next**:

        *The connection to the server was successful.*

    7.  On the **Alert Routing Rules** page, click **Add**.

    8.  In the **Add Alert Routing Rule** dialog box, create a name for the rule, select the template that you want to use to process incidents created by an alert, and then select the alert criteria that you want to use. Click **OK**, and then click **Next**.

    9. On the **Schedule** page, select **Close alerts in Operations Manager when incidents are resolved or closed** or **Resolve incidents automatically when the alerts in Operations Manager are closed**, click **Next**, and then click **Create**.

5.  Start the Operations Manager console.

6.  In the **Administration** pane, click **Product Connectors**, and then click **Internal Connectors**.

7.  In the **Connectors** pane, click the name of the alert connector.

8.  In the **Actions** pane, click **Properties**.

9. In the **Alert Sync: *name of connector*** dialog box, click **Add**.

10. In the **Product Connector Subscription Wizard** dialog box, on the **General** page, in the **Subscription Name** box, type the name for this subscription. For example, type **All Alerts**, and then click **Next**.

11. On the **Approve groups** page, click **Next**.

12. On the **Approve targets** page, click **Next**.

13. On the **Criteria** page, click **Create**.

14. In the **Alert Sync:*name of connector*** dialog box, click **OK**.

### To validate the creation of an Operations Manager alert connector

-   Confirm that the connector you created is displayed in the Service Manager console in the **Connectors** pane.

-   Confirm that incidents are created in Service Manager from alerts in Operations Manager.

### To create an Operations Manager CI connector

1.  In the Service Manager console, click **Administration**.

2.  In the **Administration** pane, expand **Administration**, and then click **Connectors**.

3.  In the **Tasks** pane, under **Connectors**, click **Create Connector**, and then click **Operations Manager CI Connector**.

4.  Complete the following steps to complete the Operations Manager CI Connector Wizard:

    1.  On the **General** page, in the **Name** box, type a name for the new connector. Make sure that the **Enable** check box is selected, and then click **Next**.

    2.  On the **Server Details** page, in the **Server name** box, type the name of the server that is hosting the Operations Manager root management server.

    3.  Use one of the following methods to enter credentials:

        -   Under **Credentials**, select the Run As account you created for the alert connector, and then go to step 4d.

        -   Under **Credentials**, click **New**. In the **User name**, **Password**, and **Domain** boxes, type the credentials for the Run As account, and then click **OK**.

    4.  On the **Server Details** page, click **Test Connection**. If you receive the following confirmation message, click **OK**, and then click **Next**:

        *The connection to the server was successful.*

    5.  On the **MP Selection** page, click **Select all**, or select the management packs that define the configuration items you want to import, and then click **Next**.

    6.  On the **Schedule** page, click **Next**, and then click **Create**.

### To validate the creation of an Operations Manager CI connector

-   Confirm that the objects that Operations Manager discovered are listed as configuration items in Service Manager.

### To confirm the status of an Operations Manager connector

-   View the columns in the **Connector** pane; the columns contain information about the start time, the finish time, the status, and the percentage of import completion.

![](../../media/pssymbol.png)You can use a Windows PowerShell command to complete these tasks, as follows:
