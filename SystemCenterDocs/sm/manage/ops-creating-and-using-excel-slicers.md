# Creating and Using Excel Slicers

>Applies To: System Center 2016 - Service Manager

The most useful reporting data available from Service Manager is in the form of data cubes. One method of viewing and manipulating cube data is using PivotTables in Microsoft Excel. You can use slicers in Excel to filter PivotTable data.  

 Slicers are easy\-to\-use filtering components that contain a set of buttons that enable you to quickly filter the data in a PivotTable report, without the need to open drop\-down lists to find the items that you want to filter.  

 When you use a regular PivotTable report filter to filter on multiple items, the filter indicates only that multiple items are filtered, and you have to open a drop\-down list to find the filtering details. However, a slicer clearly labels the filter that is applied and provides details so that you can easily understand the data that is displayed in the filtered PivotTable report.  

 For more information about Excel slicers, see [Use slicers to filter PivotTable data](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=246040) on the Microsoft Office website.
