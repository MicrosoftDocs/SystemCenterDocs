# Usage Metering in Service Provider Foundation
As a hoster, [!INCLUDE[spfshort](../Token/spfshort_md.md)] provides usage metering that enables you to:

-   Obtain metrics for tenant usage consumption for virtual machines, CPU, memory, network, and disk.

-   Determine capacity utilization.

-   Bill tenants for their usage according their plans.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> [!INCLUDE[spfshort](../Token/spfshort_md.md)] provides the Usage web service to be used only by [!INCLUDE[katal_1](../Token/katal_1_md.md)] or by third party billing providers. The Usage web service endpoint should not be accessed for other purposes to prevent data loss due to unnecessary or erroneous queries.

> [!TIP]
> For information on integrating usage with a generic billing system using the [!INCLUDE[katal_long](../Token/katal_long_md.md)], see the Usage Extensibility.docx Microsoft Word document that is available in the download of "Web Sites, Virtual Machines, Service Management Portal, and Service Management API Samples \- Feb 2013" from the [Microsoft Download Center](http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9830030).
