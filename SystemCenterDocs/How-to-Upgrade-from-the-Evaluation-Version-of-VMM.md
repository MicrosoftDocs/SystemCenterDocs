# How to Upgrade from the Evaluation Version of VMM
If you did not provide a product key when you installed [!INCLUDE[vmm12sp1_long](Token/vmm12sp1_long_md.md)], [!INCLUDE[vmm12short](Token/vmm12short_md.md)] installs as an evaluation version that expires in 180 days after installation. You can upgrade an evaluation version to a licensed version before the evaluation version expires. After the evaluation version expires, it cannot be upgraded.

To upgrade from an evaluation version of [!INCLUDE[vmm12short](Token/vmm12short_md.md)] to a licensed version before the expiration date of the evaluation version, you must obtain a valid product key from Microsoft, and you must be a member of the Administrator user role. For information about [!INCLUDE[vmm12short](Token/vmm12short_md.md)] licensing, see System Center Licensing.

> [!TIP]
> The number of days remaining in your evaluation version is displayed in the title bar of the VMM console window.

1.  In the VMM console, in the upper left corner above the ribbon, click the down arrow, and then click **About**.
