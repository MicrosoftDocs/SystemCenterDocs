# System Center 2016 Technical Preview 5
Welcome to the [!INCLUDE[sc_threshold_1](../Token/sc_threshold_1_md.md)]. We are releasing this version of System Center so you can try out new features that build on the improvements included in [!INCLUDE[winthreshold_server_1](../Token/winthreshold_server_1_md.md)]. This is the fourth release of [!INCLUDE[sc_threshold_1](../Token/sc_threshold_1_md.md)]. In this documentation System Center is referred to as [!INCLUDE[sc_threshold_1](../Token/sc_threshold_1_md.md)] unless there is a need to distinguish between this release and a previous release. Windows Server Technical Preview 5 is also referred to as Windows Server Technical Preview, unless there is a reason to specify a particular release of Technical Preview.

**This information is preliminary and subject to change.**

The components updated for this release are:

-   [!INCLUDE[scdp_threshold_1](../Token/scdp_threshold_1_md.md)]
