# Known Issues and Troubleshooting in Management Pack for Azure SQL Managed Instance

This article lists the known issues for Management Pack for Azure SQL Managed Instance.

|Issue title|Behavior / Symptom|Known workaround|
|-|-|-|
|Rules and monitors may provide incorrect data|If the **Interval (seconds)** overridable parameter is lower than the default one, rules and monitors may provide incorrect data.|Make sure that the **Interval (seconds)** overridable parameter is set to no lower than the default value.|
|Watcher node event log issues|If a managed instance is not available, multiple errors appear in the watcher node event log. These errors will keep coming until the managed instance is available.|No resolution.|
|The exception is received if an instance is not available|When an instance is not available, the **SqlOsPerfCounterReaderHelper** exception is received in the event log. This exception will keep coming until the instance is back online. The interval of this exception is equal to the lowest interval set for the performance rules.|No resolution.|
|Odd behavior of monitors operational states|If the resource pool contains more than one management server, the operational states of all monitors will be changing according to the failover settings of the resource pool.|No resolution.|
|Extended discovery intervals|In cases of using a resource pool with several watcher nodes, the discovery intervals may be significantly extended.|No resolution.|
|Error messages may appear in the Operations Manager events after adding a new database to the already monitored MI|Either of the following error messages may appear after adding a new database to already monitored MI: "Skipping the default startup of the database because the database belongs to an availability group" or "The database cannot be opened due to inaccessible files, insufficient memory or lack of disk space".|No resolution.|
|The **Memory-Optimized Data Stale Checkpoint File Pairs** Ratio monitor may not change its state|The **Memory-Optimized Data Stale Checkpoint File Pairs Ratio** monitor may not change its state from **Warning** to **Success**.|Reset the health state of the monitor.|
|Error messages may appear in the event log after monitoring template creation|"Windows logins are not supported in this version of SQL Server" or "SQL credentials are not set" error messages may appear in the Operations Manager event log after the creation of a monitoring template.”|These are temporary issues related to management pack workflows initialization.|
|The managed instance is not discovered and discovery or monitoring error alerts appear|Discovery and monitoring alerts appear with the following message: “Object reference not set to an instance of an object” right after creation of a monitoring template, and the error event 4225 is thrown in the OpsMan log. No managed instances are discovered. Most likely, these errors indicate that the Azure SQL MI Monitoring Pool resource pool has not been discovered and the managed instance cannot be bound to this pool.|Wait until a discovered managed instance appears in the Managed Instances state view (it can take up to a few hours), then close “Azure SQL MI Instance: Discovery error” and/or “Azure SQL MI: Monitoring error” alerts generated by rules. To speed up the discovery process, decrease the intervals for both the "Azure SQL MI: Generic Monitoring Pool Watcher Discovery" and the "Discover All Management Servers Pool Watcher" discoveries to force them to run right away, give it 10 minutes and then restore the default intervals.|
