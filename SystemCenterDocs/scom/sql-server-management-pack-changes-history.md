### What's new

- Added support for [custom management server resource pools](sql-server-management-pack-sql-server-monitoring-pool.md) for agentless monitoring mode
- Added new ["SQL Connection Encryption Certificate Status"](sql-server-management-pack-monitoring-configuration.md#sql-server-connection-encryption-certificate-monitoring) monitor for SQL Server on Linux, which targets Database Engine and checks if the server's transport layer security (TLS) certificate is valid
- Updated the "Product Version Compliance" monitor with the most recent version of public updates for the SQL Server
- Improved accessibility for the Summary Dashboard view and Monitoring Wizard template, including the following major changes:
  - improved keyboard navigation
  - improved color contrast in dashboards for better legibility
  - reworked high contrast theme for dashboards
  - added support for screen-reading software
- Updated display strings

### Bug fixes

- Fixed the issue of Summary Dashboard view not working in the System Center Operations Manager Console when operational and data warehouse databases are hosted on SQL Server version 2022

## July 2023 - 7.2.0.0 RTM

### What's new

- Updated the [custom monitoring](sql-server-management-pack-custom-monitor.md), which allows the creation of monitors and performance rules, now it's on the separate package installer
- Added a query execution and time synchronization schedule filtering mode for the custom monitoring
- Added the 'Number of samples' override to the "Availability Group Automatic Failover, Availability Group Online, Availability Replicas Data Synchronization, Availability Replicas Role, Availability Replicas Connection, and Synchronous Replicas Data Synchronization" unit monitors to help avoid alert storming
- Added new ["SQL Connection Encryption Certificate Status"](sql-server-management-pack-monitoring-configuration.md#sql-server-connection-encryption-certificate-monitoring) monitor, which targets the Database Engine and is capable to check the TLS certificate validation period in days and the certificate requirements for the SQL Server on Windows
