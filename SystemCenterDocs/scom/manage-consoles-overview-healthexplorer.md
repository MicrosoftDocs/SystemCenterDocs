# Using Health Explorer in Operations Manager

>Applies To: System Center 2016 - Operations Manager

In System Center 2016 - Operations Manager, you can use the Health Explorer tool to define and diagnose failures on your network. Health Explorer gives you the ability to view and then take action on alerts, state changes, and other significant issues generated by monitoring objects on your network.  
  
You can start Health Explorer from the **Tasks** pane after you select an object, alert, or event in the results pane. Health Explorer organizes health information into the following categories:  
  
-   Performance  
  
-   Security  
  
-   Availability  
  
-   Configuration  
  
All monitors and rules that are defined for a selected object display in the appropriate category.

The icons used to indicate state are as follows:  
  
|Icon|Meaning|  
|--------|-----------|  
|![White button indicates unknown status](./media/manage-consoles-overview-healthexplorer/om2016-Unknownicon.png)|Unknown, unmonitored (blank)|  
|![Green check icon indicates healthy](./media/manage-consoles-overview-healthexplorer/om2016-healthyicon.png)|Success, health is OK (green)|  
|![Yellow triangle and exclamation mark is warning](./media/manage-consoles-overview-healthexplorer/om2016-warningicon.png)|Warning (yellow)|  
|![Red button with white X indicates critical state](./media/manage-consoles-overview-healthexplorer/om2016-criticalicon.png)|Critical (red)|  
|![Wrench icon indicates maintenance mode](./media/manage-consoles-overview-healthexplorer/om2016-maintenancemodeicon.png)|Maintenance mode (gray)|  
|![Grayed-out healthy icon](./media/manage-consoles-overview-healthexplorer/om2016-healthygrayicon.png)|Out of contact (gray)|  
  
By default, when the Health Explorer windows first opens, all monitors that are in a failed, or red, state are expanded. If a monitor contains other monitors, as in the case of a roll\-up monitor, all monitors are shown in a hierarchical layout so that monitoring data for all dependent services and applications is displayed. If you want to view more detail on any dependent monitor, right\-click that monitor and then click **Monitor Properties** to open another Health Explorer window.  
  
When the Health Explorer window is open, you can review a history of diagnostic tests that have run automatically and the output from those tasks. You can also run additional diagnostic tasks. Any task that is formatted as a hyperlink can run directly from the **Knowledge** tab.  
  
The Health Explorer window refreshes automatically every 30 seconds. Press the F5 function key for an immediate refresh.
