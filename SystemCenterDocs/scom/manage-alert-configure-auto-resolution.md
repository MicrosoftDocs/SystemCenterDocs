# Configure automatic alert resolution



In System Center Operations Manager, alerts are resolved automatically after a specific number of days. You can change the automatic alert resolution settings globally for the management group. Using automatic alert resolution, you can configure all active alerts with a resolution state of **New** to be changed to **Closed** after a specific number of days. You can also configure all active alerts with a resolution state of **New** to be changed to **Closed** after a specific number of days when the alert source is healthy.  

## Change the global settings for automatic alert resolution  

1. In the Operations console, select **Administration**.  

2. Select **Settings**.  

3. Double-click **Alerts**.  

4. Select the **Automatic Alert Resolution** tab.

6. Select **OK**.  

## Next steps

- To get better visibility with the alerts being generated in your environment and determine which are the candidates for additional configuration to reduce alert noise and improve alert accuracy, see [Data-driven Alert Management](manage-alert-data-driven-management.md) from the Operations console.

- To understand how alerts are generated for monitored objects in your management group, see [How an Alert is Produced](manage-alert-generation-overview.md).

- To understand how it can help you review alerts that have been generated by rules and monitors which are still active, review [Viewing Active Alerts](manage-alert-view-alerts-details.md).
