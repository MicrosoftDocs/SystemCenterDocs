# Azure SQL Database Run As Accounts

This article describes how to configure Azure SQL Database run as accounts in Management Pack for Azure SQL Database.

To monitor Azure SQL Database servers, create one or more **Simple** or **Basic** Run As accounts. For more information about Run As accounts, see [Manage Run As accounts and profiles](manage-security-maintain-runas-profiles.md).

To create Run As accounts, follow these steps:

1. In the System Center Operations Manager console, right-click the **Administration | Run As Configuration | Accounts** node, and select **Create Run As Account**.

6. Select **Close** to close the window.

7. Right-click the newly created account and select **Properties**.
