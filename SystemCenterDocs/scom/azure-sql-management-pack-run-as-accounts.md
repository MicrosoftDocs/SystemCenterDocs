# Azure SQL Database Run As Accounts

To monitor Azure SQL Database servers, create one or more **Simple** or **Basic** Run As accounts. For more information about Run As accounts, see [Managing Run As accounts and profiles](manage-security-maintain-runas-profiles.md).

To create Run As accounts, perform the following steps:

1. In the System Center Operations Manager console, right-click the **Administration | Run As Configuration | Accounts** node, and select **Create Run As Account**.

3. At the **General Properties** step, from the **Run As account type** drop-down list, select **Simple Authentication**, enter a display name and optional description, and click **Next**.

6. Click **Close** to close the window.

7. Right-click the newly created account and select **Properties**.
