# Configuring antivirus exclusions for Operations Manager agent and components

>Applies To: System Center 2016 - Operations Manager

This article outlines antivirus exclusions as they pertain to System Center 2016 â€“ Operations Manager.  For earlier versions of Operations Manager, see [Recommendations for antivirus exclusions](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/975931/recommendations-for-antivirus-exclusions-that-relate-to-operations-man).

## Exclusions by process executable

If exclusions are configured based on process executable, exclude the following processes:
* Monitoringhost.exe

>[!NOTE]
>You must be careful when you add exclusions that are based on executables. Incorrectly configured exclusions may prevent some potentially dangerous programs from being detected.  Therefore, we do not recommend relying on exclusions that are based on any process executables for Operations Manager servers.

## Exclusions by directories
The following directory-specific exclusions for Operations Manager includes real-time scans, scheduled scans, and local scans. The directories that are listed here are default application directories so you may have to modify these paths based on your specific environment. Only the following Operations Manager related directories should be excluded.

>[!NOTE]
>When a directory that is to be excluded has a directory name greater than 8 characters long, add both the short and long directory names of the directory to the exclusion list. These names are required by some antivirus programs to traverse sub-directories.

|Component | Directory Exclusion |
|----------|----------|
|SQL Server database server | Exclude the directory containing the .ldf and .mdf files for all Operations Manager databases,<br>Report server databases, and the **master** and **tempdb** databases. |
|Management server | C:\Program Files\Microsoft System Center 2016\Operations Manager\Server\Health Service State |
| Gateway server | C:\Program Files\System Center Operations Manager\Gateway\Health Service State |
| Agent | C:\Program Files\Microsoft Monitoring Agent\Agent\Health Service State |
