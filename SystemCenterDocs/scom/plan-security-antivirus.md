This article outlines antivirus exclusions that relate to System Center 2019 Operations Manager and later.  For earlier versions of Operations Manager, see [antivirus exclusions (Operations Manager 2012, 2012 R2, and 2016)](/troubleshoot/system-center/scom/antivirus-exclusions-recommendations).

For specific exclusion recommendations for supported versions of SQL Server, see [KB309422](https://support.microsoft.com/help/309422/choosing-antivirus-software-for-computers-that-run-sql-server).

## Exclusions by process executable

If exclusions are configured based on process executable, exclude the following processes:

|Component | Process |
|--------|---------|
|**Management servers** |MonitoringHost.exe<br> HealthService.exe<br> Microsoft.Mom.Sdk.ServiceHost.exe<br> cshost.exe |
|**Gateway server** |HealthService.exe<br> MonitoringHost.exe |
|**Windows agent** |HealthService.exe<br> MonitoringHost.exe |
|**Web Console server** |HealthService.exe<br> MonitoringHost.exe |
|**SQL Server**<sup>1</sup> |HealthService.exe<br> MonitoringHost.exe |

<sup>1</sup> For SQL Server servers hosting the Operations Manager databases (Operational, Data Warehouse, ACS) and Reporting server role.

>[!NOTE]
>You must be careful when you add exclusions that are based on executables. Incorrectly configured exclusions may prevent some potentially dangerous programs from being detected. Therefore, we don't recommend relying on exclusions that are based on any process executables for Operations Manager servers.

## Exclusions by directories

The following directory-specific exclusions for Operations Manager include real-time scans, scheduled scans, and local scans. The directories that are listed here are default application directories, so you may have to modify these paths based on your specific environment. Only the following Operations Manager related directories should be excluded.

>[!NOTE]
>When a directory that is to be excluded has a directory name greater than 8 characters long, add both the short and long directory names of the directory to the exclusion list. These names are required by some antivirus programs to traverse sub-directories.
