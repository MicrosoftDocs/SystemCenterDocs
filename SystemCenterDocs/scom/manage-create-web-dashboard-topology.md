When created for the first time, the health state icons for the selected objects are displayed at the left-top section of the topology widget. These icons have to be placed manually in the appropriate position on the image by performing the following steps:

1. Select on the ellipsis **â€¦** next to the **X** on the right-most side of the widget crown, which is displayed when you hover over the widget.

2. Select **Edit icons layout** action to reposition the health state icons for the selected objects on the selected image. While editing the icon layout, the health state icons will also display the object name of the specific object.

3. Once the selected object icons have been repositioned appropriately, select **Go** under **Save icons layout** to save reconfigured positioning of the icons.

Now your topology dashboard visualizes the health of objects positioned on the selected image.
