# Overview of HTML5 Web console and dashboards



System Center Operations Manager now delivers HTML5-based dashboards, which enhance the authoring and visualization experiences for Web console users. With these improvements, you can visualize operational data with richer data visualizations, faster performance, and drill-down.  You can access these dashboards from multiple browsers (such as Chrome) and are no longer dependent on Silverlight.

## Supported scenarios
You can take advantage of the following HTML5 dashboard capabilities:

::: moniker range="sc-om-2019"

   Additional view options are included in Alert and State widget from 2019 UR3. For more information, see [Support for Sort by option](manage-create-web-dashboard-alerts.md#support-for-sort-by-option).

::: moniker range="sc-om-2022"

 Additional view options are available in Alert and State widget. For more information, see [Support for Sort by option](manage-create-web-dashboard-alerts.md#support-for-sort-by-option).
