# Views and Dashboards in Management Pack for SQL Server Reporting Services

Management Pack for SQL Server Reporting Services introduces a common folder structure that will be used in future releases of management packs for different components of SQL Server.

For more information about the common folder structure, see [Views and Dashboards in Management Pack for SQL Server](ssmp-views-and-dashboards.md).

The following figure shows an example of views that are available in Management Pack for SQL Server Reporting Services.

Some of these views may consist of a very long list of objects and metrics. To find specific objects, you can use the **Scope**, **Search**, and **Find** buttons on the Operations Manager toolbar. For more information, see [Finding data and objects in the Operations Manager consoles](manage-console-finding-data.md).
