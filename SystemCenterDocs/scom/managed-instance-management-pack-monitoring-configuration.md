# Monitoring Configuration in Management Pack for Azure SQL Managed Instance

This section explains monitoring configurations in Management Pack for Azure SQL Managed Instance.

## Monitoring Templates

Management Pack for Azure SQL Managed Instance has two monitoring templates for monitoring of Azure SQL Managed Instance:

- [Azure SQL MI – Automatic](managed-instance-management-pack-automatic-monitoring-managed-identity.md)

    This template allows you to configure monitoring by discovering all managed instances in the specified Azure subscription automatically.

- [Azure SQL MI – Manual](managed-instance-management-pack-manual-monitoring.md)

    This template allows you to add the selected instances to the monitoring list by specifying connection strings manually.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Using both the templates at the same time may cause manually added instances to be monitored by two sets of monitoring workflows. This leads to redundant use of resources and may also cause performance issues.

## Space Monitoring

Management Pack for Azure SQL Managed Instance is capable of performing space monitoring by collecting a set of metrics at the following levels:

- Instance
- Database

For instance space monitoring, the management pack checks storage utilization at the Azure SQL Managed Instance level. For database space monitoring, the management pack checks storage utilization at the database level, which can be measured for the following types:

- **ROWS Data Free Space Left**

  Monitors available database space and space available on the media that hosts the database in percentage terms. This monitor doesn't count the free space for FILESTREAM and In-Memory OLTP Data filegroups.

- **LOG Free Space Left**

  Monitors available database transactional log space in percentage terms.

- **In-Memory OLTP Data Free Space Left**

  Monitors available database space and the space available on the media that hosts the database in percentage terms. This monitor doesn't count free space for In-Memory OLTP and In-Memory OLTP Data filegroups.

## Database Backup Monitoring

Management Pack for Azure SQL Managed Instance provides a monitor that checks the existence and age of a database backup as reported by Microsoft SQL Server. This is done by running a query against the master database of the SQL instance and returning the age of the backup.

> [!NOTE]
> The monitor tracks `COPY_ONLY` backups. Differential, log, and file snapshot backups aren't considered. For more information, see [BACKUP (Transact-SQL)](/sql/t-sql/statements/backup-transact-sql).

## Securables Configuration Status Monitor

This monitor checks if each of the required SQL Server securables is accessible under the configured [monitoring account](managed-instance-management-pack-security-configuration.md).

The following is a complete list of securables that are checked by the monitor targeted to the Azure SQL Managed Instance:

- Server-Level permissions
  - VIEW SERVER STATE
  - VIEW ANY DEFINITION
  - VIEW ANY DATABASE

- SELECT permission on dynamic management views
  - sys.dm_os_performance_counters
  - sys.dm_tran_active_transactions
  - sys.dm_tran_session_transactions
  - sys.dm_exec_sessions
  - sys.dm_exec_requests
  - sys.dm_exec_connections
  - sys.dm_os_sys_info
  - sys.dm_os_host_info
  - sys.dm_os_ring_buffers
  - sys.dm_os_volume_stats
  - sys.dm_os_threads
  - sys.dm_hadr_database_replica_states
  - sys.dm_hadr_fabric_partition_states
  - sys.dm_hadr_fabric_config_parameters
  - sys.dm_hadr_fabric_continuous_copy_status
  - sys.dm_db_xtp_checkpoint_files
  - sys.dm_db_xtp_table_memory_stats
  - sys.dm_db_xtp_hash_index_stats
  - sys.dm_internal_resource_governor_resource_pools

- SELECT permission on catalog views
  - sys.databases
  - sys.database_files
  - sys.tables
  - sys.filegroups
  - sys.syscolumns
  - sys.sysprocesses
  - sys.configurations
  - sys.syslanguages
  - sys.server_resource_stats
  - msdb.dbo.sysjobschedules
  - msdb.dbo.backupset

- EXECUTE permission on stored procedures
  - sys.sp_enumerrorlogs
  - sys.xp_readerrorlog
  - sys.xp_instance_regread
  - msdb.dbo.sp_help_jobactivity
  - msdb.dbo.sp_help_job

## Database Status Monitoring

Database status monitoring is intended to check the database status as reported by the Azure SQL Managed Instance. Status check is done by running a query against the master database of the Azure SQL Managed Instance that returns the database state. If you receive an alert from this monitor, an action is required in order to bring the database back to an operational state.

All database states except the ONLINE one will result in an unhealthy monitor state. The following table defines the database states.

|State|Definition|  
|-----------|----------------|  
|ONLINE|Database is available for access. The primary filegroup is online, although the undo phase of recovery may not have been completed.|  
|OFFLINE|Database is unavailable. A database becomes offline by explicit user action and remains offline until additional user action is taken. For example, the database may be taken offline in order to move a file to a new disk. The database is then brought back online after the move has been completed.|  
|RESTORING|One or more files of the primary filegroup are being restored, or one or more secondary files are being restored offline. The database is unavailable.|  
|RECOVERING|Database is being recovered. The recovering process is a transient state; the database will automatically become online if the recovery succeeds. If the recovery fails, the database will become suspect. The database is unavailable.|  
|RECOVERY PENDING|SQL Server has encountered a resource-related error during recovery. The database isn't damaged, but files may be missing or system resource limitations may be preventing it from starting. The database is unavailable. Additional action by the user is required to resolve the error and let the recovery process be completed.|  
|SUSPECT|At least the primary filegroup is suspect and may be damaged. The database can't be recovered during startup of SQL Server. The database is unavailable. Additional action by the user is required to resolve the problem.|  
|EMERGENCY|User has changed the database and set the status to EMERGENCY. The database is in single-user mode and may be repaired or restored. The database is marked READ_ONLY, logging is disabled, and access is limited to members of the **sysadmin** fixed server role. EMERGENCY is primarily used for troubleshooting purposes. For example, a database marked as suspect can be set to the EMERGENCY state. This could permit the system administrator read-only access to the database. Only members of the **sysadmin** fixed server role can set a database to the EMERGENCY state.|
|COPYING|Database is being copied across managed instances by using Always On availability group technology. The copy feature creates a new database on the destination instance as a copy of the source database. With this feature, data replication is reliable, consistent, asynchronous, and near real-time. When you copy a database, the source database remains online during the operation and after it's completed. The database is available.|
|OFFLINE_SECONDARY|Database is available for access after the failover, which performs full data synchronization between primary and secondary databases before the secondary switches to the primary role. This guarantees no data loss. Failover is only possible when the primary is accessible. The database is available.|

For more information, see [Database States](/sql/relational-databases/databases/database-states).

## Geo-Replication Database Monitoring

Management Pack for Azure SQL Managed Instance utilizes a monitor that checks the replication status of the primary and secondary databases located in an auto-failover group.

The monitor reports an unhealthy state, which indicates that the secondary database isn't transactionally consistent and isn't being constantly synchronized with the primary database.

To verify the replication status, the management pack uses the 'sys.dm_hadr_fabric_continuous_copy_status' DVM. Based on the DVM replication states, the monitor changes its health state accordingly.

|Replication State|Description|Health State|
|-|-|-|
|CATCH_UP|The secondary database is in a transactionally consistent state and is being constantly synchronized with the primary database.|Healthy|
|SEEDING|The geo-replication target is being seeded but the two databases aren't yet synchronized. Until seeding completes, you can't connect to the secondary database. Removing secondary database from the primary will cancel the seeding operation.|Critical|
|PENDING|This isn't an active continuous-copy relationship. This state usually indicates that the bandwidth available for the interlink is insufficient for the level of transaction activity on the primary database. However, the continuous-copy relationship is still intact.|Critical|
