Operations Manager Reporting server component provides report-specific schedules to help you control processing and distribution of reports.  Once you have configured a schedule for a report, it can be managed from the Reporting workspace, under the Scheduled Reports node in the Operations console.  

## To create a report schedule

Use the following procedure to create a schedule from a saved report.  Report schedules can be created after the report open or when saved as a Favorite report.  The following steps will show you how to create a schedule from a saved report, however; the same steps for configuring the schedule can be performed from an open report by selecting **File**, **Schedule..** from the main menu.  

For more information on how to run and save a report, see [How to Run, Save, and Export a Report](manage-reports-run-save-export.md).

1.  Log on to the computer with an account that is a member of the Operations Manager Report Operators role.  

2.  In the Operations console, click **Reporting**.  

3.  In the **Reporting** workspace, click **Favorite Reports**.  

4.  In the **Favorite Reports** pane, right-click the Availability report you saved as a favorite, and then click **Schedule**.  

5.  In the **Subscribe to a Report Wizard**, on the **Delivery Settings** page, do the following:  

    1.  Type a description in the **Description** text box.

    3.  Type a file name for the report in the **File name** text box.  

    4.  Type a file path for the report in the **Path** text box.  Report scheduling supports Universal Naming Convention \(UNC\) file names and must not end in a backslash.  

    5.  Click the down arrow in the **Render Format** list, and then click the file format you want for the report.  

    6.  Type a user name in the **User name** text box, and then type a password in the **Password** text box.  

        > [!NOTE]  
        > The credentials must have Write user rights on the file share.  

    7.  Click the down arrow in the **Write mode** list, select the Write mode you want for subsequent files, and then click **Next**.  

6.  In the **Subscribe to a Report Wizard**, on the **Subscription Schedule** page, do the following:  

    1.  Select one of the **Generate the report** options.  

    2.  Type a start date and start time for the reports to be generated in  **The Subscription is effective beginning** list. You can also enter the date when this subscription will end in **The subscription expires on** list, and then click **Next**.  

7.  In the **Subscribe to a Report Wizard**, on the **Parameters** page, specify a span of time for the report in the **From** and **To** lists.  

8.  Make any other changes you need for this report, and then click **Finish**.
