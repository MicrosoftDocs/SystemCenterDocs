Operations Manager Reporting server component provides report-specific schedules to help you control the processing and distribution of reports. Once you've configured a schedule for a report, it can be managed from the Reporting workspace under the Scheduled Reports node in the Operations console.  

## Create a report schedule

Use the following procedure to create a schedule from a saved report. Report schedules can be created after the report opens or when saved as a Favorite report. The following steps will show you how to create a schedule from a saved report; however, the same steps for configuring the schedule can be performed from an open report by selecting **File**, **Schedule..** from the main menu.  

For more information on how to run and save a report, see [How to Run, Save, and Export a Report](manage-reports-run-save-export.md).

1.  Sign in to the computer with an account that is a member of the Operations Manager Report Operators role.  

2.  In the Operations console, select **Reporting**.  

3.  In the **Reporting** workspace, select **Favorite Reports**.  

4.  In the **Favorite Reports** pane, right-click the Availability report you saved as a favorite, and select **Schedule**.  

5.  In the **Subscribe to a Report Wizard**, on the **Delivery Settings** page, do the following:  

    1.  Enter a description in the **Description** text box.  

    2.  Select the down arrow in the **Delivery method** list, and select **Report Server File Share**.  

    3.  Enter a file name for the report in the **File name** text box.  

    4.  Enter a file path for the report in the **Path** text box. Report scheduling supports Universal Naming Convention (UNC) file names and must not end in a backslash.  

    5.  Select the down arrow in the **Render Format** list, and select the file format you want for the report.  

    6.  Enter a user name in the **User name** text box, and enter a password in the **Password** text box.  

        > [!NOTE]  
        > The credentials must have Write user rights on the file share.  

    7.  Select the down arrow in the **Write mode** list, select the Write mode you want for subsequent files, and select **Next**.  

6.  In the **Subscribe to a Report Wizard**, on the **Subscription Schedule** page, do the following:  

    1.  Select one of the **Generate the report** options.  

    2.  Enter a start date and start time for the reports to be generated in the **The Subscription is effective beginning** list. You can also enter the date when this subscription will end in the **The subscription expires on** list, and select **Next**.  

7.  In the **Subscribe to a Report Wizard**, on the **Parameters** page, specify a span of time for the report in the **From** and **To** lists.  

8.  Make any other changes you need for this report, and select **Finish**.  


## Email scheduled reports

The report server email delivery extension isn't configured by default. You must use the Reporting Services Configuration Manager to minimally configure the extension. For more  information on how to configure SQL Server Reporting Services for email delivery, see [Configure a Report Server for E-Mail Delivery (SSRS Configuration Manager)](/sql/reporting-services/install-windows/configure-report-server-urls-ssrs-configuration-manager).

1. Verify that the Report Server Windows service has **Send As** permissions on the SMTP server.

2. Start the **Reporting Services Configuration Manager** and connect to the report server instance.

3. On the **Email Settings** page, enter the name of the SMTP server. This value can be an IP address, a UNC name of a computer on your corporate intranet, or a fully qualified domain name.

4. In **Sender Address**, enter the name of an account that has permission to send email from the SMTP server.

5. Select **Apply** and select **Exit**.

    5. Select the down arrow in the **Priority** list, and then select the appropriate priority.  

    6. Enter a subject for the email in the **Subject** text box.  

    7. Select **Next**.

## Schedule the delivery of a report to the SQL Report Server Cache  

You can create a schedule for sending reports to the cache in the SQL Server Report Server and thereby shorten the time required to retrieve a report if the report is large or accessed frequently. For more information about report caching, see [Caching Reports (SSR)](/sql/reporting-services/report-server/caching-reports-ssrs).  

The example in this procedure uses an availability report that you've already created and saved as a favorite.

    1.  Enter a description in the **Description** text box.  

    2.  Select the down arrow in the **Delivery method** list, and select **Null Delivery Provider**.  

    3.  Select **Next**.  

6.  On the **Subscription Schedule** page, do the following:  

    1.  Select one of the **Generate the report** options.  

    2.  Enter a start date and start time for the reports to be generated in **The Subscription is effective beginning** list. You can also enter the date when this subscription will end in **The subscription will end** list, and select **Next**.  

7.  On the **Parameters** page, specify a span of time for the report in the **From** and **To** lists, make any other changes you need for this report, and select **Finish**.
