        1.  **The Online Service.** The Online Service allows you to submit your website URLs included in your Customer Data in order to test the availability and performance of those identified web sites against certain configurations set by you, and b) provides the test results to you.

        3.  **Responsibility for your IDs and account.** You are solely responsible for protecting the confidentiality of your Credentials for your Microsoft Account for Organizations associated with this Agreement.

You will not give feedback that is subject to a license that requires Microsoft to license the Online Service to third parties because we include your feedback in them. These rights survive this Agreement.

    1.  **Agreement term.** This Agreement will remain in effect for 90 days from the date you activate a Trial Subscription of this Online Service.  
  
    2.  **Conversion of a Trial Subscription and Effect of Conversion.** The full service version of this Online Service is only available as a benefit of Software Assurance coverage. However, you may convert your Trial Subscription to a full service Online Service account via an SA Benefit during the Term if:  
  
        1.  you are a current Volume Licensing customer, and  
  
        2.  have active Software Assurance on eligible products as defined in the “[!INCLUDE[gsmlong](../includes/gsmlong-md.md)]” section of the Microsoft Product List.

    3.  **Termination by you.** You may terminate this Agreement and thus cancel your Trial Subscription or convert your Trial Subscription to an SA benefit at any time during the Term. You must follow the process, if available, on the Portal or otherwise contact Microsoft customer service (see contact information on the Portal) to terminate this Agreement and your Trial Subscription. In the event that you terminate this Agreement and, therefore, cancel your Trial Subscription, Microsoft has no obligation to retain Customer Data and or any test results and may delete Customer Data immediately and will delete any active test results not delivered to the System Center Operations Manager after one (1) hour.

        1.  you violate the terms of this Agreement;  
  
        2.  we are otherwise required by law to do so  
  
        3.  we believe that your use of the Online Service represents a direct or indirect threat to our network function or integrity or anyone else’s use of the Online Service; or  
  
        4.  we decide to cease providing the Online Service.  
  
    5.  **Regulatory environment: modification or termination by Microsoft.** We may modify or terminate an Online Service in any country where there is any current or future government requirement or obligation that subjects us to any regulation or requirement not generally applicable to businesses operating there, presents a hardship for us to continue operating the Online Service without modification, and/or causes us to believe these terms or the Online Service may be in conflict with any such requirement or obligation. For example, we may modify or terminate the Online Service in connection with a government requirement that would cause us to be regulated as a telecommunications provider.  
  
    6.  **Effect of termination, cancellation or expiration on Supplement Software.** If this Agreement and your Trial Subscription is cancelled, terminated or expires, and you do not elect to upgrade to a full service account, then you must delete all copies of Supplemental Software licensed under this Agreement and destroy any associated media.

            2.  disable your account and then delete your Customer Data.  
  
            3.  You agree that, other than as described above, we have no obligation to continue to hold, export, or return the Customer Data and/or any test results. You agree that we have no liability whatsoever for deletion of your Customer Data and/or test results pursuant to these terms.  
  
5.  **Confidentiality.**  
  
     We and you shall treat the design and performance of the Online Service that is accessible to you only via password protected access and any documentation or materials we make available to you under this Agreement as confidential and shall not disclose them to any third party except in the furtherance of the parties’ business relationship with each other.  If you are a government customer, this Section is subject to the requirements of applicable trade secret, public records, or similar laws.  
  
6.  **Warranties.**

We will also pay the amount of any resulting adverse final judgment (or settlement to which we consent). This Section provides your exclusive remedy for these claims.  
  
    2.  **What you must do.** You must notify us promptly in writing of the claim and give us sole control over defense or settlement. You must also provide us with reasonable assistance in defending the claim.  We will reimburse you for reasonable out of pocket expenses that you incur in providing that assistance.  
  
    3.  **Limitations on defense obligation.** Our obligations will not apply to the extent that the claim or award is based on:

             You will reimburse us for any costs or damages that result from any of the above actions.  
  
    4.  **Specific rights and remedies in case of infringement.**  
  
        1.  **Our rights in addressing possible infringement.** If we receive information concerning an infringement claim related to an Online Service, we may, at our expense and without obligation to do so: (1) procure for you the right to continue to use the allegedly infringing Online Service; (2) modify the Online Service; (3) replace the Online Service with a functional equivalent, to make it non-infringing, in which case you will immediately stop using the allegedly infringing Online Service after receiving notice from us; or (4) terminate any Trial Subscriptions relating to the Online Service.

HOWEVER, THIS EXCLUSION DOES NOT APPLY TO EITHER PARTY'S LIABILITY TO THE OTHER FOR VIOLATION OF ITS CONFIDENTIALITY OBLIGATIONS (EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH VIOLATION RELATES TO CUSTOMER DATA), THE OTHER PARTY'S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, OR THE PARTIES' RESPECTIVE OBLIGATIONS IN THE SECTION TITLED "DEFENSE OF INFRINGEMENT, MISAPPROPRIATION, AND THIRD PARTY CLAIMS."
