# Install the Visio Add-in

You can download the Visio Add-in from the [Microsoft Download Center](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=29268).  

>[!NOTE]
>While the page on the Download Center specifies System Center 2012, the add-in does support System Center 2016 - Operations Manager.

The Visio Add-in for System Center Operations Manager has the following prerequisites:  

-   System Center 2016 or later - Operations Manager.  

-   Microsoft Office Visio 2010 or 2013 Professional or Premium.  

-   Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 SP1. For Windows 8, 8.1, and 10, see [Installing the .NET Framework 3.5 on Windows 8, Windows 8.1 and Windows 10](/dotnet/framework/install/dotnet-35-windows-10).

## To install the Visio Add-in

When you run the Setup program for the Visio Add-in, your system is checked against these requirements. If your system doesn't meet the requirements, a link is provided so that you can download the missing software.  

1.  In Windows Explorer, navigate to the directory where you downloaded the Add-in and then double-click **OpsMgrAddinSetup.msi**. This is the installation file for the client.  

2.  Select **Next** on the Welcome page of the installation wizard.  

3.  Read the license agreement, select **I Agree**, and then select **Next**.  

4.  Specify the installation location, and then select **Next**.  

5.  Select **Next** to start the installation.  

6.  Select **Close** when the installation is complete.  

The next time you start Visio, you're asked if you want to install the Visio Add-in. Select **Install**. When the installation is complete, the Operations Manager command is available in the Visio ribbon.
