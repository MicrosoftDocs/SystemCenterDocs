# How to install the Operations Manager Reporting server

::: moniker range=">= sc-om-1801 <= sc-om-1807"

[!INCLUDE [eos-notes-operations-manager.md](../includes/eos-notes-operations-manager.md)]

::: moniker-end

In this procedure, the Reporting server is installed on a standalone server that's hosting the SQL Server database and SQL Server Reporting Services.

> [!WARNING]
> Although SQL Server Reporting Services is installed on the standalone server, Operations Manager reports aren't accessed on this server; instead, they are accessed in the **Reporting** workspace in the Operations console.

You must ensure that your server meets the minimum system requirement for Operations Manager. For more information, see [System Requirements for System Center - Operations Manager](./system-requirements.md).

::: moniker range="sc-om-2019"

>[!NOTE]
>Operations Manager 2019 UR1 and later supports a single installer for all supported languages, instead of language-specific installers. The installer automatically selects the language based on the computer's language settings where you're installing it.

::: moniker range="sc-om-2022"

>[!NOTE]
>- Operations Manager supports a single installer for all supported languages, instead of language-specific installers. The installer automatically selects the language based on the computer's language settings where you're installing it.
>- Installation of Reporting and Web Console will be successful irrespective of the updates installed on Operations Manager Management Server.

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range="sc-om-2016"

>[!NOTE]
>If your security policies restrict TLS 1.0 and 1.1, installing a new Operations Manager 2016 Reporting services role will fail because the setup media doesn't include the updates to support TLS 1.2. The only way you can install this role is by enabling TLS 1.0 on the system, apply Update Rollup 4, and then enable TLS 1.2 on the system. This limitation doesn't apply to Operations Manager version 1801.

## Install Operations Manager reporting

SQL Server Reporting Services installed on this instance of SQL Server can be used only by Operations Manager. If any reports exist on this SSRS instance, the System Center Operations Manager Reporting Services installer overrides all of the data/reports on it.

Ensure that SQL Server Reporting Services has been correctly installed and configured. For more information about how to install and configure SQL Server Reporting Services, see [SQL Server Installation](/sql/database-engine/install-windows/install-sql-server).

> [!NOTE]
> Before you continue with this procedure, ensure that the account that you are using to run the installer for the Operations Manager Reporting Role has [SA (sysadmin)](/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/configure-windows-service-accounts-and-permissions) on both the Operational Database (_OperationsManager_) and Reporting (_ReportServer_) SQL Instances. This will allow the installer to deploy all logins and permissions as required. The SA role can be safely removed from the account used for the installer after installation. Otherwise, the Setup fails, and all changes are rolled back, which may leave SQL Server Reporting Services in an inoperable state. If this happens you can attempt run a tool to reset SSRS to a working condition. The programs is: **ResetSRS.exe** which is an executable inside of the support tools folder on your Operations Manager installation media.

## Install Reporting Services on NTLM hardened enterprises

In Operations Manager 2016 and later, if NTLM is disabled as an organization policy, Operations Managerâ€™s reporting services were impacted. For organizations with NTLM disabled, you can select the Reporting Manager **Authentication Type**, as **Windows Negotiate** while installing. NTLM is the default option.

>[!Note]
>*Authentication Type* options are available only when you install the reporting manager on a remote server.  

### Prerequisites to disable NTLM

- If SSRS and SQL both installed on remote servers, ensure [SDK](/troubleshoot/system-center/scom/http-500-error-connecting-to-web-console#register-the-sdk-spns), [SSRS](/sql/reporting-services/report-server/register-a-service-principal-name-spn-for-a-report-server), and [SQL](/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/register-a-service-principal-name-for-kerberos-connections) SPNs are set.
- If SSRS is installed on remote server and SQL and Management Server are installed on the same server, [SDK](/troubleshoot/system-center/scom/http-500-error-connecting-to-web-console#register-the-sdk-spns) and [SSRS](/sql/reporting-services/report-server/register-a-service-principal-name-spn-for-a-report-server) SPNs are required.
- If SQL installed on remote server and SSRS and Management Server are installed on the same server, ensure that [SQL](/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/register-a-service-principal-name-for-kerberos-connections), [SSRS](/sql/reporting-services/report-server/register-a-service-principal-name-spn-for-a-report-server), and [SDK](/troubleshoot/system-center/scom/http-500-error-connecting-to-web-console#register-the-sdk-spns) SPNs are set.

#### Verify that Reporting Services is configured correctly

Follow these steps to verify that Reporting Services is configured correctly:

1.  Verify that the **ReportServer** and **ReportServerTempDB** databases in SQL Server Management Studio are located on the standalone server. Open **SQL Server Management Studio**, and then connect to the default database instance. Open the **Databases** node, and verify that the two Reporting Services databases exist under this node.

2.  Verify the correct configuration of SQL Server Reporting Services. Select **Start**, point to **Programs**, point to the appropriate offering of Microsoft SQL Server, point to **Configuration Tools**, and select **Reporting Services Configuration Manager**. Connect to the instance on which you installed Reporting Services.

3.  In the navigation pane, select the `<servername>\SQLinstance`. This displays the Report Server status in the results pane. Ensure that the **Report Server Status** is **Started**.

4.  In the navigation pane, select **Scale-out Deployment**, and ensure that the **Status** column has the value of **Joined**.

5.  If **Report Server** isn't started and the **Scale out Deployment** isn't joined, check the configuration of **Service Account**, **Web Service URL**, and **Database**.

6.  Confirm that the SQL Server Reporting Services service is running. On the taskbar, select **Start**, point to **Administrative Tools**, and select **Services**.

7.  In the **Name** column, find the **SQL Server Reporting Services** instance service and verify that its status reads **Started** and that the **Startup Type** is **Automatic**.

8.  In the **Name** column, find the **SQL Server Agent** service and verify that its status reads **Started** and that its **Startup Type** is **Automatic**.

9. Verify that the Report Server website is functioning and available by browsing to `http://<servername>/reportserver/_<$instance>`. You should see a page with the `<servername>/ReportServer/_<$instance>` and the text, **Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services Version** ##.#.####.## where the # is the version number of your SQL Server installation.

10. Verify that the Report Manager website is configured correctly by opening **Internet Explorer** and browsing to `http://<servername>/reports/_<$instance>`.

11. In the Report Manager website, select **New Folder** to create a new folder. Enter a name and description, and select **OK**. Ensure that the new, created folder is visible on the Report Manager website.
