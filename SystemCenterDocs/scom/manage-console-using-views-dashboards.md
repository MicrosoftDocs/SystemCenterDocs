# Using views and dashboards in Operations Manager

In Operations Manager, views provide insight into the performance of your service, its health state, or the issues detected and presented in an alerts view.  Views return independent data based on specific criteria, whereas dashboard are a way to view operational data in a condensed, single pane of glass, which your operations, engineering, and the business can use to make meaningful decisions. There are various types of dashboards that can accommodate the various roles in your IT organization. You may have a data storage Manager that wants to see the percentage of SQL servers using more than the allocated amount of disk space; you may have a systems engineer managing a web site with high traffic and wants to know what average requests per/sec are for all his Web servers. Dashboards convey information succinctly and in a compact format so that the end user can decide if they need to take action immediately.

After you identify the IT services to monitor, the configuration of how to monitor them, you need to configure how that data will be visualized and provided to the different personas in the organization who are responsible for sustaining and maintaining the service, the end-users who want to see a summarized availability status of critical services provided, and management who are interested in determining if IT is meeting its service objectives to the business.
