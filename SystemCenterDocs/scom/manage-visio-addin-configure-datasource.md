Before Visio can interact with System Center - Operations Manager or version 1801, you need to configure Operations Manager as a data source for your Visio document. You also need to configure the Operations Manager Web console address to enable opening the Health Explorer or Alert view directly from Visio. You need to configure these items for each Visio document you create.  

>[!NOTE]
>For version 1801, configuring the Visio add-in to point to the HTML5 web console isn't supported and should continue referencing the System Center 2016 - Operations Manager Web console in order to support launching the Health Explorer and Alert view from Visio diagrams.

## To configure the Operations Manager data source and web console address in Visio  

1.  Open a new drawing in Visio.  

2.  Select **Operations Manager** in the ribbon, and select **Configure**.  

3.  In the **Name** field, enter the computer name of a management server in the management group.  

4.  In the **Address** field, enter the address for the web console. This is the console that is used to launch the Health Explorer and Alert view from Visio.  

    If you don't know the address, and you've Operations Manager administrator privileges, select **Look up web console address**. If you don't know the address, and you aren't an Operations Manager administrator, contact the administrator for the address, and then enter it in the **Address** field.  

5.  If you want to receive regular updates of state information from the management server, select **Automatically refresh data**, and then specify a refresh interval in seconds.  

6.  Select **OK**.
