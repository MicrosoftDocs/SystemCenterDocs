# New experience for alerts generated by monitors

The existing alert closure experience for the alerts generated by monitors has been revamped for better experience and value.

In earlier releases, if you close the alert while the monitor is in a warning, critical or unhealthy state, the problem remains unresolved, and no further alerts are generated, unless the health state for the monitor has also been reset to healthy. If the monitor is not reset, the same condition that generated an alert can occur again but no alert will be generated because the health state has not changed.

This behavior, which often led to a scenario where there is no active alert in the system, while an underlying problem exists, is fixed in Operations Manager 2019.

An alert, generated by a monitor cannot be closed unless the health stateof the corresponding monitor is healthy. If you try to close an alert generated by an unhealthy monitor, an error message appears and the alert will not be closed.

Use the following procedures to see the behavior of the alerts that you close, when the monitor statefor the corresponding alert is not healthy.   

## 	Operations console
1.	Open the OM console and click **Monitoring**

**Monitoring Overview** displays a summary of health states of the monitors and the current alerts.
2.	Click **Active Alerts** in the navigation pane.
3.	Right-click an alert, which is generated by a monitor that is in unhealthy status.
4.	Set the resolution state as **Closed**

    The following message appears stating the reason for non-closure of the alert:

    **Alert(s) in the current selection cannot be closed as the monitor(s) which generated these alerts are still unhealthy. For more details on the alerts which could not be closed, view the “Alert Closure Failure” dashboard in the Operations Manager Web Console**

5. To close this alert the health state of the monitor has to be reset, if “auto-resolve” for this monitor is set to true then the alert will be auto closed with the health state reset else the alert has to be manually closed after the health state reset.

##  Web Console
1.	Open the Web Console and click **Monitoring**.
    **Monitoring Overview** displays a summary of health statuses of the monitors and the current alerts.
2. Close an alert/alerts.

    You can choose any of the following options to close the alerts.

    Close alerts from *Active Alerts** menu.

       1. Click **Active Alerts** in the navigation pane.
       2. Right-click an alert, which has been generated by a monitor in unhealthy status.
       3. Set the resolution state as **Closed**.

   Close alerts from *Active Alerts Dashboard*

    1. Click **Active Alerts Dashboard** in the navigation pane.
    2. Open an alert, which has been generated by a monitor in unhealthy status.
    3. Set the resolution state as **Closed** and **Save** changes.

    The following message appears stating the reason for non-closure of the alert:

    **The current alert cannot be closed as the monitor that has generated this alert is still unhealthy**

    ![closed alert message web console](./media/enhanced-alert-closure-experience/nonclosure-message-web-console.png)

    To close this alert, you must manually reset the health of the corresponding monitors that generated this alert.

## Reset the health state of a monitor for a specific alert

Use the following steps:

1. Click **Alert Closure Failure** dashboard in the navigation pane.
The dashboard lists the alerts, which OM was unable to close because the monitor which has generated the alert is **unhealthy**.
2.	You can reset the health state of the monitor for the corresponding alert, in the following two ways:
 -  Select an alert in the dashboard and then select the dashboard action **Reset Health for Alert** or
 -  Click an alert in this dashboard to navigate to the alerts drill-down page (where you can visualize all the relevant information for an alert), select the **Reset Health task** in the task pane.
