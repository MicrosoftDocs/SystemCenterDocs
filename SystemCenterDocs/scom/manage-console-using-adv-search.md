# Using advanced search

>Applies To: System Center 2016 - Operations Manager

In System Center 2016 - Operations Manager, advanced search is available in My Workspace, when you create a new search. You can also open advanced search in the Monitoring workspace on the **Tools** menu.  
  
Use advanced search to search for a specific object type that meets specified criteria. Advanced search has two steps:  
  
-   Select the specific object type and criteria 
  
-   Set the criteria values  
  
You can also save the searches you create.  
  
## Select the specific object type and criteria  

Each object type will display a unique set of criteria for your search. The following table lists the object types and the criteria available for each.  
  
|Object type|Criteria associated with the object type|  
|---------------|--------------------------------------------|  
|Alerts|-   Of a specific severity<br>-   Of a specific priority<br>-   Created by specific sources<br>-   With specific resolution state<br>-   With a specific name<br>-   With specific text in the description<br>-   Created in specific time period<br>-   Assigned to a specific owner<br>-   Raised by an instance with a specific name<br>-   Last modified by a specific user<br>-   That was modified in specific time period<br>-   Had its resolution state changed in a specific time period<br>-   That was resolved in a specific time period<br>-   Resolved by specific user<br>-   With a specific ticket ID<br>-   Was added to the database in a specific time period<br>-   For a specific site<br>-   With specific text in the available custom fields|  
|Events|-   Generated by specific rules<br>-   With a specific event number<br>-   From a specific source<br>-   Generated in specific time period<br>-   Raised by an instance with a specific name<br>-   With specific severity level<br>-   From a specific user<br>-   Logged by a specific computer|  
|Managed Objects|-   With a specific name<br>-   In specific health state<br>-   Contained in a specific group|  
|Monitors|-   With a specific name<br>-   With specific text in the description<br>-   The monitor has been overridden for any context (excluding category overrides)<br>-   With specific category<br>-   Creates an alert when specific state is detected<br>-   The monitor generates alerts of specific priority<br>-   Auto-resolves alerts<br>-   The monitor is a unit monitor<br>-   The monitor is an aggregate monitor<br>-   The monitor is a dependency monitor|  
|Object Discoveries|-   With a specific name<br>-   With specific text in the description<br>-   The object discovery has been overridden for any context (excluding category overrides)<br>-   With specific category<br>-   Is enabled<br>-   The object discovery confirms delivery<br>-   The rule is remotable <sup>1</sup><br>-   Was added in a specified time period<br>-   Was modified in a specified time period|  
|Rules|-   With a specific name<br>-   With specific text in the description<br>-   The rule has been overridden for any context (excluding category overrides)<br>-   With specific category<br>-   The rule generates alerts of specific priority<br>-   Is enabled<br>-   The rule confirms delivery<br>-   The rule is remotable <sup>1</sup><br>-   Was added in a specified time period<br>-   Was modified in a specified time period|  
|Tasks|-   With a specific name<br>-   With specific text in the description<br>-   Is enabled<br>-   Was added in a specified time period<br>-   Was modified in a specified time period|  
|Views|-   With a specific name<br>-   With specific text in the description<br>-   Was added in a specified time period<br>-   Was modified in a specified time period|  
  
<sup>1</sup> A remotable rule or discovery can run against a computer that does not have an agent installed.  
  
## Set the criteria values 
 
If you have ever created a rule in Microsoft Outlook, setting criteria values for an advanced search will be familiar to you. When you select a criterion for an object, it is added to the **Criteria description** section. Most criteria contain a variable value. For example, in the criterion **With a specific name**, *specific* is a variable and will be underlined in the **Criteria description** section. (The criterion **Is enabled** is only true or false, so it contains no variables; you either select it or you do not select it.)  
  
To assign a value to the variable, click the underlined portion of the criterion. A dialog box appears. In the example of **With a specific name**, you enter a text string for the specific name. For variables with limited values, such as alert priorities, the dialog box provides checkboxes that you can select.  
  
## Running and saving searches  

After you set the values for the search criteria, you can run the search by clicking **Search** or you can save the search by clicking **Save parameters to My Favorites**. Saved searches are displayed in My Workspace and can be run at any time.  
  
When you run a search or a saved search, a window opens with a view appropriate to the object type of your search. For example, a search on object type **Alerts** opens an Alert View window. A hyperlinked action, **Show parameters**, is displayed below the view title bar. You can click **Show parameters** to change the search parameters.  
  
> [!NOTE]  
> When you run a saved search, change the parameters, click **Search**, and then close the results window, you will be asked if you want to save the changes to the search.  
  
## Examples of using advanced search in Operations Manager

The following table lists examples of using advanced search to find objects in Operations Manager:  
  
|To find|Use this object, condition, and value|  
|-----------|---------------------------------|  
|All alerts closed in the previous 2 hours.|-   **Object:** Alerts<br>-   **Condition/Value:** With specific resolution state/Closed<br>-   **Condition/Value:** That was resolved in a specific time period/Last 2 Hours|  
|All rules that have overrides|-   **Object:** Rules<br>-   **Condition:** the rule has been overridden for any context (excluding category overrides)|  
|All monitors that auto-resolve alerts|-   **Object:** Monitors<br>-   **Condition:** auto-resolves alerts|  
|All Unix computers in a warning or critical state|-   **Object:** Managed Objects<br>-   **Condition/Value:** In specific health state/warning, critical<br>-   **Condition/Value:** Contained in a specific group/Unix Computer Group|
