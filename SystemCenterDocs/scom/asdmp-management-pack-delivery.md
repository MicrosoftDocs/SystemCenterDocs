## Importing Management Pack

>[!NOTE]
>If you have been using an agnostic version of [Management Pack for SQL Server](ssmp-supported-configuration.md) prior to the upgrade, you can remove both the **Microsoft.SQLServer.Generic.Dashboards.mp** management pack and the **Microsoft.SQLServer.Generic.Presentation.mp** management pack after the upgrade. For a non-agnostic version of Management Pack for SQL Server, the removal of these management packs is not possible.
