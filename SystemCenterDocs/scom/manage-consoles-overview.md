To Know the difference between them, see [Comparing the Operations and Web console](manage-consoles-comparison.md). Also learn how to configure them after installation, and how to use the consoles to view the operational data reported by the monitored services in the enterprise.  

- Learn [How to Connect to the Operations and Web Console](manage-consoles-how-to-connect.md) in order to access and interact with the operational data or perform administrative tasks.  

- Health Explorer gives you the ability to view and then take action on alerts, state changes, and other significant issues generated by monitoring objects in your enterprise.  To learn how to use this feature, see [Using Health Explorer](manage-consoles-overview-healthexplorer.md).  

- In the Operations and Web console, learn how to [Use My Workspace](manage-consoles-my-workspace.md) to customize views and dashboards for your specific needs.
