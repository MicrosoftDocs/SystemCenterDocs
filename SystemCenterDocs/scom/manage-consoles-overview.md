# Manage Operations console and Web console in Operations Manager

System Center – Operations Manager includes two consoles:

- Operations console
- Web console

For the differences between these consoles, see [Comparing the Operations and Web console](manage-consoles-comparison.md). This article also explains how to configure the consoles after installation and how to use them to view the operational data reported by the monitored services in the enterprise.  

- Learn [How to Connect to the Operations and Web Console](manage-consoles-how-to-connect.md) in order to access and interact with the operational data or perform administrative tasks.  

- Health Explorer enables you to view and take action on alerts, state changes, and other significant problems generated by monitoring objects in your enterprise. For more information, see [Using Health Explorer](manage-consoles-overview-healthexplorer.md).  

- In the Operations and Web console, learn how to [Use My Workspace](manage-consoles-my-workspace.md) to customize views and dashboards for your specific needs.

- Learn what actions you can perform in the [Monitoring workspace](manage-using-monitoring-workspace.md), [Authoring workspace](manage-using-authoring-workspace.md), [Administration workspace](manage-using-admin-workspace.md), and [Reporting workspace](manage-using-reporting-workspace.md).  

- Understand how [Finding data and objects in the Operations console](manage-console-finding-data.md) and [Using Advanced Search](manage-console-using-adv-search.md) help you quickly locate the data you need.
