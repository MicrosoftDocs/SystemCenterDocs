# Using the Operations Manager consoles

>Applies To: System Center 2016 - Operations Manager
  
System Center 2016 – Operations Manager includes two consoles, the Operations console and Web console.  The [Comparing the Operations and Web console](manage-consoles-comparison.md) section provides information on the difference between them, how to configure them after installation, and how to use the consoles to view the operational data reported by the monitored services in the enterprise.  

- Learn [How to Connect to the Operations and Web Console](manage-consoles-how-to-connect.md) in order to access and interact with the operational data or perform administrative tasks.  

- In the Operations console, you view monitoring data, manage monitoring configuration, create your own custom views and dashboards that are personalized for your experience, and perform management group administration by [Using the Operations Manager Operations console](../om/manage/using-the-operations-console-in-operations-manager.md).   
  
- Health Explorer gives you the ability to view and then take action on alerts, state changes, and other significant issues generated by monitoring objects in your enterprise.  To learn how to use this feature, see [Using Health Explorer](manage-consoles-overview-healthexplorer.md).  

- In the Operations and Web console, learn how to [Use My Workspace](../om/manage/using-my-workspace-in-operations-manager.md) to customize views and dashboards for your specific needs.
