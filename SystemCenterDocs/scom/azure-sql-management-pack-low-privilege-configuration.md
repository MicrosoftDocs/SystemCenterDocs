# Low-Privilege Configuration

This section explains how to configure low-privilege accounts to monitor the Azure SQL Database service.

To configure a low-privilege account, perform the following steps:

1. Connect to the **master** database and create server-level credentials for the low-privilege monitoring user by executing the following query:

      ```SQL
      CREATE LOGIN [MonitoringUser] WITH PASSWORD = <'YourPassword'>
      ```

2. Connect to the **master** database and map server-level credentials to the database user by executing the following query:

      ```SQL
      CREATE USER [MonitoringUser] FOR LOGIN [MonitoringUser] WITH DEFAULT_SCHEMA = sys
      ```

3. In every user database (excluding the **master** members), map server-level credentials to the database user and grant it the **VIEW DATABASE STATE** permission by executing the following query:

      Use the **MonitoringUser** value when [configuring Azure SQL Database Run As Accounts](azure-sql-management-pack-run-as-accounts.md).

      ```SQL
      CREATE USER [MonitoringUser] FOR LOGIN [MonitoringUser] WITH DEFAULT_SCHEMA = sys
      GO
      GRANT VIEW DATABASE STATE TO [MonitoringUser]
      ```
