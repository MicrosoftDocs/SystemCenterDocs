# Configuring a Firewall for Operations Manager

::: moniker range=">= sc-om-1801 <= sc-om-1807"

[!INCLUDE [eos-notes-operations-manager.md](../includes/eos-notes-operations-manager.md)]

::: moniker-end

This section describes how to configure your firewall to allow communication between the different Operations Manager features on your network.  

> [!NOTE]
> Operations Manager does not support LDAP over SSL (LDAPS) at this time.

## Port assignments

The following table shows Operations Manager feature interaction across a firewall, including information about the ports used for communication between the features, which direction to open the inbound port, and whether the port number can be changed.

|Operations Manager Feature A|Port Number and Direction|Operations Manager Feature B|Configurable|Note|
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------|--------|
|Management server|1433/TCP&nbsp;--->&nbsp;<br>1434/UDP&nbsp;--->&nbsp;<br>135/TCP&nbsp;(DCOM/RPC)&nbsp;--->&nbsp;<br>137/UDP&nbsp;--->&nbsp;<br>445/TCP&nbsp;--->&nbsp;<br>49152-65535&nbsp;--->|Operations Manager database|Yes (Setup)|WMI Port 135 (DCOM/RPC) for the initial connection and then a dynamically assigned port above 1024.

### <a name="footnote1"></a> Management Pack Catalog web service <sup>1</sup>

To access the Management Pack Catalog web service, your firewall and/or proxy server must allow the following URL and wildcard (*):

- `https://www.microsoft.com/mpdownload/ManagementPackCatalogWebService.asmx`
- `http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/*`

### <a name="footnote2"></a> Identify SQL port <sup>2</sup>

- The default SQL port is 1433, however this port number can be customized based on organizational requirements. To identify the configured port, follow these steps:
    1. In SQL Server Configuration Manager, in the console pane, expand **SQL Server Network Configuration**, expand **Protocols** for \<instance name\>, and then double-click **TCP/IP**.
    2. In the **TCP/IP Properties** dialog, on the **IP Addresses** tab, note the port value for **IPAll**.  

- If using a SQL Server configured with an Always On Availability Group or after migrating an installation, do the following to identify the port:  
    1. In Object Explorer, connect to a server instance that hosts any availability replica of the availability group whose listener you want to view. Select the server name to expand the server tree.
    2. Expand the **Always On High Availability** node and the **Availability Groups** node.
    3. Expand the node of the availability group, and expand the **Availability Groups Listeners** node.
    4. Right-click the listener that you want to view, and select the **Properties** command, opening the **Availability Group Listener Properties** dialog window, where the configured port should be available.

### <a name="footnote3"></a>Kerberos authentication <sup>3</sup>

For Windows clients using Kerberos authentication, and reside in a different domain from where the management servers are located, there are extra requirements that that must be met:

1. A [two-way transitive trust](/entra/identity/domain-services/concepts-forest-trust) must be established between domains.
1. The following ports must be open between the domains:
   1. TCP/UDP port 389 for LDAP.
   1. TCP/UDP port 88 for Kerberos.
   1. TCP/UDP port 53 for Domain Name Service (DNS).
