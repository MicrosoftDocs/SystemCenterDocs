# Configuring a Firewall for Operations Manager

::: moniker range=">= sc-om-1801 <= sc-om-1807"

[!INCLUDE [eos-notes-operations-manager.md](../includes/eos-notes-operations-manager.md)]

::: moniker-end

This section describes how to configure your firewall to allow communication between the different Operations Manager features on your network.  

>[!NOTE]
> Operations Manager uses port 389 for LDAP queries for multiple actions such as agent discovery, active directory integration, and so on. Operations Manager doesn't support LDAPs.

## Port assignments
The following table shows Operations Manager feature interaction across a firewall, including information about the ports used for communication between the features, which direction to open the inbound port, and whether the port number can be changed.

|Operations Manager Feature A|Port Number and Direction|Operations Manager Feature B|Configurable|Note|
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|----------------|--------|
|Management server|1433/TCP ---> <br>  1434/UDP ---> <br>  135/TCP (DCOM/RPC) ---> <br> 137/UDP ---> <br> 445/TCP ---> <br> 49152-65535 --->   |Operations Manager database|Yes (Setup)|WMI Port 135 (DCOM/RPC) for the initial connection and then a dynamically assigned port above 1024.

> <a name="footnote1"></a> Note 1: Management Pack Catalog web service
> - The following URLs must be allowed by your firewall to allow the Management Pack Catalog web service to be accessible:
>   1. https://www.microsoft.com/mpdownload/ManagementPackCatalogWebService.asmx
>   2. http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=148038&clcid=0x409

- If SQL Server is installed with a default instance, the port number is 1433. If SQL Server is installed with a named instance, by default it's configured with a dynamic port. To identify the port, do the following:

  1. In SQL Server Configuration Manager, in the console pane, expand **SQL Server Network Configuration**, expand **Protocols** for \<instance name\>, and then double-click **TCP/IP**.
  2. In the **TCP/IP Properties** dialog, on the **IP Addresses** tab, note the port value for **IPAall**.  

- If you plan on deploying the Operations Manager databases on a SQL Server configured with an Always On Availability Group or migrate after installation, do the following to identify the port:

  1. In Object Explorer, connect to a server instance that hosts any availability replica of the availability group whose listener you want to view. Select the server name to expand the server tree.
  2. Expand the **Always On High Availability** node and the **Availability Groups** node.
  3. Expand the node of the availability group, and expand the **Availability Groups Listeners** node.
  4. Right-click the listener that you want to view, and select the **Properties** command.
  This opens the **Availability Group Listener Properties** dialog.
