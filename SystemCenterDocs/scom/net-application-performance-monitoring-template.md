# .NET application performance monitoring template

::: moniker range=">= sc-om-1801 <= sc-om-1807"

[!INCLUDE [eos-notes-operations-manager.md](../includes/eos-notes-operations-manager.md)]

::: moniker-end

The  **.NET Application Performance Monitoring**  (APM) template in System Center â€“ Operations Manager lets you monitor Internet Information Services (IIS)-hosted .NET applications from server- and client-side perspectives to get details about application performance and reliability that can help you pinpoint root causes of incidents. (For System Center 2012 SP1 only: You can also monitor Windows Services.) When you specify settings, the types of events to collect, the performance goals to measure, and servers to monitor, .NET Application Performance Monitoring reveals how applications are running. You can see how frequently a problem is occurring, how a server was performing when a problem occurred, and the chain of events related to the slow request or method that is raising exceptions. This information is required to partner with software developers and database administrators to help ensure that applications perform correctly and reliably for your customers.

This template lets you monitor applications and web services that are hosted in Internet Information Services (IIS) 7.0. You can select one or more applications or services discovered by the IIS 7.0 management pack and configure monitoring of performance and exception events. You must have the Windows Server 2008 Internet Information Services (IIS) 7.0 management pack installed to monitor applications and web services.

For System Center 2012 SP1, you can use the template to monitor applications and web services that are hosted in Internet Information Services (IIS) 8.0. You can select one or more applications or services discovered by the IIS 8.0 management pack and configure monitoring of performance and exception events. You must have the Windows Server 2012 Internet Information Services (IIS) 8.0 management pack installed to monitor applications and web services.

For more information, see [Before You Begin Monitoring .NET Applications](/previous-versions/system-center/system-center-2012-r2/hh543994(v=sc.12))

## Scenarios

Use the  **.NET Application Performance Monitoring**  template in scenarios where you've to monitor web-based applications. These scenarios include the following monitoring processes:

## Server-side monitoring: single- or multi-tier web applications

You might have applications that must always be running. Use the **.NET Application Performance Monitoring** template to ensure that your applications are reliable, have no exceptions, and meet service level agreements (SLAs). In short, they perform correctly on the computers where they're installed.

## Client-side monitoring: browser performance and reliability

You want to ensure that your customers are having quality web experiences. By creating or editing existing templates, you can extend your server-side monitoring by adding client-side monitoring that measures the browser experience of your customers.

## Monitoring performed by the .NET application performance monitoring template

By default, the  **.NET Application Performance Monitoring**  template configures the following monitoring. You can enable, disable, and modify monitors in the **Advanced Configuration**  page of the **.NET Application Performance Monitoring** template.

| Monitor description | Default values |
| --- | --- |
| Percentage of exception events per monitored requests | Enabled, Threshold=15%, Interval=5 minutes |
| Percentage of performance events per monitored requests | Enabled, Threshold=20%, Interval=5 minutes |
| Average Request Time | Enabled, Threshold=10,000 ms, Interval=5 minutes |

## Viewing monitoring data

All data collected by the **.NET Application Performance Monitoring** template appears in the  **.NET Monitoring**  folder in the  **Application Monitoring**  folder in the  **Monitoring**  navigation pane. For each of the application groups that you create by using the  **.NET Application Performance Monitoring**  template, the template creates a folder under  **.NET Monitoring**. The  **Application Monitoring**  folder contains the default views and subfolders that provide health state, Performance views, and alerts related to the application components in the application group. By using the top-level Application Group State view, you can see the health of the individual components and the monitoring configurations that have been enabled. The state of each object matches the state of the targeted object that has the worst health state so that you see the worst state of the monitors that are running. If one or more of the components are shown with an error while at least one other component is healthy, it could indicate a problem with that particular component, such as a credential issue. If all the components are unhealthy, it could indicate a problem with the infrastructure, such as network connectivity issues.

**Application monitoring folders**

![Screenshot of ASP.NET Application Performance Monitoring folder.](./media/aspnet-application-performance-monitoring-folder.png)

To view the state of the individual monitors, open the Health Explorer for each component. Drill down to the unhealthy monitors to see what is making your application unhealthy. For more information, see [Monitoring .NET Applications](/previous-versions/system-center/system-center-2012-R2/hh212856(v=sc.12))

## Wizard options

When you run the  **.NET Application Performance Monitoring**  template, you've to provide values for options as listed in the following tables. Each table represents a single page in the wizard.

## General properties

![Screenshot of the General properties page.](./media/general-properties-page.png)

The following options are available on the **General Properties** page of the wizard.

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Name | Enter the friendly name used for the template and application group that you're creating. This name is displayed in the Operations console and used for the folder under the  **.NET Monitoring**  folder. <br> **Note:** After you've given the template a name and saved the template, this name can't be edited without deleting and re-creating the template instance.</br> |
| Description | Describe the application group. (Optional) |
| Select destination management pack | Select the management pack to store the views and configuration created by the template. Use the same name for your new management pack as the application group so that you can easily pair the two names. You can use an existing management pack or create a new management pack. For more information about management packs, see [Selecting a Management Pack File](select-management-pack-file.md). |

## What to monitor

![Screenshot of What to monitor page.](./media/what-to-monitor-page.png)

The following options are available on the  **What to Monitor**  page of the wizard.

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Application components, Add | Search for and add or remove the application components to monitor. When you select  **Add** , the Object Search page opens, which lets you select whether you want to monitor Web Applications and Services. For System Center 2012 SP1 only: You can monitor Windows Services. <br>**Note:** For System Center 2012 SP1 only: Before you begin monitoring Windows Services, you need to configure Windows Services using the Windows Service template. Once you do this, the.NET Application Performance Monitoring template can discover the Windows Services that are running. For more information, see [**Authoring the Windows Service Template**](/previous-versions/system-center/system-center-2012-R2/hh457595(v=sc.12)).</br> |
| Environment | Select the environment in which you want to monitor your application:  **None** ,  **Production** ,  **Staging** ,  **Test** ,  **Development** , or use  **New**  to create a new tag. Typically, you want to pair the environment tag with the server group that you're monitoring. The tag is appended to the application group name and component names, letting you differentiate the event data in Application Diagnostics and Application Advisor. From a monitoring perspective, the environment tag lets you separate the same application into multiple virtual applications. <br>**Note:** After you've selected an environment tag and saved the template, the tag can't be edited without deleting and re-creating the template instance.</br> |
| Targeted group | Select specific servers to limit monitoring to this specific set of servers. This is optional. Targeted group scoping only becomes necessary when you've the same application running in multiple environments, such as production and staging, and you intend to run the template multiple times, one for each environment. In this scenario, group which machines belong to production and which belong to the staging environment, and then use the targeted groups to restrict where the configuration is propagated. You can also use groups to apply configuration to a subset of your servers. Otherwise, it isn't necessary to specify targeted group scoping if you just want to monitor all instances of a given application. |

## Object search

![Screenshot of Object Search page.](./media/object-search-page.png)

The following options are available on the **Object Search** page of the wizard.

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Search for | Select Web Applications and Services. For System Center 2012 SP1 only: You can also select Windows Services. <br>**Note:** For System Center 2012 SP1, before you begin monitoring Windows Services, you need to configure Windows Services using the Windows Service template. Once you do this, the.NET Application Performance Monitoring template can discover the Windows Services that are running. For more information, see [**Authoring the Windows Service Template**](/previous-versions/system-center/system-center-2012-R2/hh457595(v=sc.12))</br> |
| Filter by part of name (optional) | Enter part of the name of Web Application and Services that you want to select. For System Center 2012 SP1 only: You can also enter part of the name of a Windows Service that you want to select. |
| Available items | Displays the Windows Web Application and Services that are available for monitoring. For System Center 2012 SP1 only: Also displays the Windows Services that are available for monitoring. |
| Selected objects | Displays the application components that you've selected to monitor. |

## Application types and server-side transactions you can monitor

For each application type, there are several transaction types you can choose to monitor. The following options are available:

| Application type | Transaction types for System Center 2012 | Transaction types for System Center 2012 SP1 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ASP.NET Web application | - ASP.NET webpage <br> - ASP.NET web service </br> - Function | - ASP.NET webpage <br>- ASP.NET MVC page </br> - ASP.NET web service <br>- WCF method </br>- Function|
| ASP.NET Web service | - ASP.NET webpage <br> - ASP.NET web service </br> - Function |  - ASP.NET webpage <br>- ASP.NET MVC page </br> - ASP.NET web service <br>- WCF method </br>- Function|
| WCF service | Not available | - ASP.NET webpage <br>- ASP.NET MVC page </br> - ASP.NET web service <br>- WCF method </br>- Function |
| Windows service | Not available | - WCF method <br>- Function</br>


## Transaction properties: add ASP.NET web page

![Screenshot of Server-side transaction properties ASP.NET webpage.](./media/server-side-transaction-properties.png)

The following options are available on the  **Transaction Properties**  page for ASP.NET Web Page page of the wizard.

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Transaction name | Enter the friendly name for the transaction as it will be displayed on the  **Monitoring**  tab, performance counters, and elsewhere. |
| ASP.NET page | Enter the path to the page that you're configuring these monitoring settings for. |
| Performance event threshold (ms) | Set the threshold in milliseconds (ms) that a user transaction must exceed before it raises a performance event. <br>**Note:** The application component continues to monitor the page specified in the transaction by using the performance threshold that is set for the application component. This threshold is used as a second measure on the same page in the application component. If you set this threshold higher than the application component threshold, you get a single event, but you might get two performance alerts for the transaction when the threshold is breachedâ€”one from the application component and one from the transaction, depending on your alerting settings. Transactions are typically used to monitor the individual page more aggressively than the parent application, at a lower threshold, or to monitor a page where alerting has been disabled on the parent.</br> |
| Sensitivity threshold (ms) | Specify to filter out fast-running methods to reduce overall "noise" by reducing the size of the call stack by gathering less data for each event. An event is still generated if the threshold is surpassed. For more information, see [Authoring Strategies for .NET Application Monitoring](author-strategies-net-application-monitoring.md) |
| Collect alerts by event type: Connectivity | Turn on or off alerting of events, classified as connectivity alerts with errors such as "Connection Timed Out".Connectivity events are logged to the Application Diagnostics console. You have the option to choose whether to raise alerts after an Application Performance Monitoring event is generated. |

## Transaction properties: add WCF method

![Screenshot of Transaction Properties for WCF.](./media/transaction-properties-wcf.png)

The following options are available on the  **Transaction Properties**  for the  **Add WCF method settings**  page of the wizard.

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Transaction name | Enter the friendly name for the transaction as it will be displayed on the Monitoring tab, performance counters, and so on. |
| Class name | Enter the name of the class for which you're configuring these monitoring settings. The class name is in the format: Namespace.Class. For example: wcfservice.myclass. |
| Method name | Specify the name of the method that is expected to be in the class for which you're configuring these monitoring settings. |
| Performance event threshold (ms) | Set the threshold in milliseconds (ms) that a user transaction must exceed before it raises a performance event. <br>**Note:** The application component continues to monitor the page specified in the transaction by using the performance threshold that is set for the application component. This threshold is used as a second measure on the same page in the application component. If you set this threshold higher than the application component threshold, you get a single event, but you might get two performance alerts for the transaction when the threshold is breachedâ€”one from the application component and one from the transaction, depending on your alerting settings. Transactions are typically used to monitor the individual page more aggressively than the parent application, at a lower threshold or to monitor a page where alerting has been disabled on the parent.</br> |
| Sensitivity threshold (ms) | Specify to filter out fast-running methods to reduce overall "noise" by reducing the size of the call stack by gathering less data for each event. For more information, see [Authoring Strategies for .NET Application Monitoring](author-strategies-net-application-monitoring.md) |
| Collect alerts by event type: Connectivity | Turn on or off alerting of events classified as connectivity alerts, with errors such as "Connection Timed Out". Connectivity events are logged to the Application Diagnostics console. You have the option to choose whether to raise alerts after an Application Performance Monitoring event is generated. |
| Collect alerts by event type: Application failure | Turn on or off alerting of events classified as application, or code, failures. Turning off this option reduces the "noise" of many alerts raised due to code failures. Because these alerts are raised from code failures, developers usually resolve these issues. For more information, see [Authoring Strategies for .NET Application Monitoring](author-strategies-net-application-monitoring.md)Exception events are logged to the Application Diagnostics console. You have the option to choose whether to raise alerts after an Application Performance Monitoring event is generated. |
