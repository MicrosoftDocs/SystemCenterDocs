# Monitoring types

This article describes the types of monitoring that are available in Management Pack for Azure SQL Database.

## Azure REST API monitoring vs. T-SQL monitoring

The main difference between [Azure REST API](/rest/api/azure/) monitoring and T-SQL monitoring is that in T-SQL, the entire set of workflows is available for you to use.

In the Azure REST API, the following workflows aren't available due to API limitations:

- Rules
  - Azure SQL DB: DB Transactions Locks Count
  - Azure SQL DB: DB Sessions Count
  - Azure SQL DB: DB Sessions Average Memory Consumption (MB)
  - Azure SQL DB: DB Sessions Rows Returned
  - Azure SQL DB: DB Sessions Total CPU Time (ms)
  - Azure SQL DB: DB Sessions Total Read/Write Operations
  - Azure SQL DB: DB Sessions Total Memory Consumption (MB)
  - Azure SQL DB: DB Transactions Max Log Usage (MB)
  - Azure SQL DB: DB Transactions Max Running Time (minutes)
  - Azure SQL DB: DB Blocked by Firewall Count
  - Azure SQL DB: DB Failed Connections Count
  - Azure SQL DB: DB Successful Connections Count
  - Azure SQL DB: DB Deadlocks Count
- Monitors
  - Transaction Locks Count
  - Sessions Count
  - Sessions Average Memory
  - Sessions Rows Returned
  - Sessions Total CPU Time
  - Sessions Total I/O
  - Sessions Total Memory
  - Transaction Log Space Used
  - Transaction Execution Time
  - Count of Failed Connection
  - Count of connections blocked by the Firewall

To make these workflows available in the Azure REST API, select the **Use T-SQL monitoring** checkbox when you [set up Azure REST API monitoring](#set-up-azure-rest-api-monitoring), and run required T-SQL scripts.

> [!NOTE]
> To connect Microsoft System Center Operations Manager to Azure resources, your server must have the TLS 1.2 protocol enabled. To learn how to check the protocol status on your server, see [TLS 1.2 enforcement for Microsoft Entra Connect](/azure/active-directory/hybrid/reference-connect-tls-enforcement#powershell-script-to-check-tls-12).

## Set up Azure REST API monitoring

Azure REST API monitoring provides a wide range of monitoring targets.

When you use the Azure REST API, the Management Pack for Azure SQL Database uses a Microsoft Entra application (that is, a service principal name) for authentication in Microsoft Entra. The service principal name (SPN) gives access to the Azure Resource Management API. The account that you use must have either the Owner role (or greater) or any of the following roles:

- Administrator
- Service Administrator
- Co-Administrator

For more information, see [Create a Microsoft Entra application and service principal that can access resources](/entra/identity-platform/howto-create-service-principal-portal).

To monitor Azure SQL Database instances by using the Azure REST API:

1. In the Operations Manager console, go to **Authoring** > **Management Pack Templates**. Right-click **Azure SQL Database Monitoring** and select **Add Monitoring Wizard**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/azure-sql-management-pack/opening-monitoring-wizard.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows selecting the Add Monitoring Wizard link.":::

1. On **Monitoring Type**, select **Azure SQL Database Monitoring**, and then select **Next**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/azure-sql-management-pack/selecting-monitoring-target.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows selecting the Monitoring target.":::

1. On **General Properties**, enter a new name and description. For **Select destination management pack**, select a management pack to use to store the template. Then select **Next**.

   To create a new management pack, select **New**, and then follow the instructions in the wizard.

   :::image type="content" source="media/azure-sql-management-pack/configuring-general-properties.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows General properties.":::

1. On **Authentication Mode**, select **Azure Service Principal Name**, and then select **Next**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/azure-sql-management-pack/selecting-authentication-mode.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows Authentication mode.":::

1. On **Azure Endpoints**, select the **Enable checkbox if you want to change default Azure Endpoints** checkbox and modify the default Azure endpoints if necessary. Then select **Next**.

   Here are the default endpoints for creating the Azure SPN:

   - Authority URI: `https://login.windows.net`

   - Management Service URI: `https://management.azure.com`

     As described in [Ports beyond 1433 for ADO.NET 4.5](/azure/sql-database/sql-database-develop-direct-route-ports-adonet-v12), the firewall port should be port 1433. This endpoint is also used for Azure REST API.

   - Database Resource URI: `https://database.windows.net`

   - Graph API Resource URI: `https://graph.windows.net`

   :::image type="content" source="media/azure-sql-management-pack/selecting-azure-endpoints.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows Azure endpoints.":::

1. On **SPN Configuration**, select **Auto-Create SPN**.

   The following list describes the options that you can choose from:

   - **Auto-Create SPN**: Select this option if you want to create the Azure SPN automatically via the management pack library by using the Azure REST API. When this option is selected, a new Run As account that uses the specified Azure SPN is created.

   - **Use Existing Run As Profile**: Select this option if you want to use your own Azure SPN.

     If you select the **Use an existing Run As profile**, select **Next**, and then select an existing Run As account that's associated with an Azure SPN. This account is used for authentication in Azure Cloud Services.

     :::image type="content" source="media/azure-sql-management-pack/using-existing-run-as-account.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows selecting an existing Run As account.":::

   - **Enter SPN Manually**: Select this option if you already created a Run As profile (for example, by using PowerShell) that has Azure SPN credentials.

     To register the application and create the SPN manually by using the Azure portal, see [Create a Microsoft Entra application and service principal that can access resources](/entra/identity-platform/howto-create-service-principal-portal).

     > [!TIP]
     > You can skip the web URI redirection. The parameter is not needed for monitoring.

     1. In the Azure portal, on the **Access control (IAM)** pane, assign the Reader role to the SPN for the respective Azure SQL Database server. The role assignment flow is similar to the flow that is described in [Grant a user access to Azure resources by using the Azure portal](/azure/role-based-access-control/quickstart-assign-role-user-portal#grant-access).

        :::image type="content" source="media/azure-sql-management-pack/azure-spn-reader-permission.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows manual granted SPN permission in the Azure portal.":::

     1. On **SPN Configuration**, select the **Enter SPN Manually** option, and then select **Next**. Enter this information for your Azure SPN:

        - **Tenant ID**: The directory (tenant) ID from the SPN overview section.
        - **Application ID**: The application (client) ID from the SPN overview section.
        - **Client Secret**: The client secret value for the specific SPN.

        > [!NOTE]
        > The client secret value is visible only once after you create it. Copy the value to a secure location to use later.

        The information is used to create a new Run As account for authentication in Azure Cloud Services.

        :::image type="content" source="media/azure-sql-management-pack/entering-spn-manually.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows Enter SPN manually.":::

        If needed, you can create and configure a new Microsoft Entra ID application and Azure SPN by using [Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azure/?preserve-view=true&view=azps-2.8.0). For more information, see [Use Azure PowerShell to create a service principal with a certificate](/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-authenticate-service-principal-powershell).

        When you create a Run As account on **Enter SPN Manually Status**, review the status, and then select **Next**.

        :::image type="content" source="media/azure-sql-management-pack/reviewing-spn-status.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the SPN status.":::

     1. *Optionally*, on **Server Filter List**, select the filtering mode, which can be either **Exclude** or **Include**. Select the filtering mask type, which can be either **Wildcard** or **Regular Expression**. Enter filtering masks, which should match SQL Server names that you want to exclude from or include in the monitoring list. Then select **Add** > **Next**.

        The **Wildcard** filtering mask type can contain only a server name. The value can contain only lowercase letters, numbers, and the `-` character, but it can't start with or end with the `\` character, and it can't contain more than 63 characters. A server exclude list filter mask ignores whitespaces.

         :::image type="content" source="media/azure-sql-management-pack/configuring-server-include-wildcard-list.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the server exclude list wildcard SPN.":::

         The **Regular Expression** filtering mask type supports .NET regular expression patterns.

         :::image type="content" source="media/azure-sql-management-pack/configuring-server-exclude-regular-expression-list.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the server exclude list regular expression SPN.":::

         If you want to remove an existing mask, select the mask type, and then select **Delete**.  

     1. *Optionally*, on **Database Filter List**, select the filtering mode, which can be either **Exclude** or **Include**. Select the filtering mask type, which can be either **Wildcard** or **Regular Expression**. Enter filtering masks, which should match database names that you want to exclude from or include in the monitoring list. Then select **Add** > **Next**.

        The **Wildcard** filtering mask type can't end with `.` or space characters, it can't contain `<`, `>`, `%`, `&`, `:`, `\`, `/`, `?`, or control characters, and it can't have more than 128 characters.

        :::image type="content" source="media/azure-sql-management-pack/configuring-database-include-wildcard-list.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the database exclude list wildcard SPN.":::

        For example, if you select the **Exclude** option and set the *dev*, *test*, *stage*, and *dbnotmon* masks, the monitoring behavior works as described in the following table:

        |Database name|Monitored status|
        |-|-|
        |dev|Not monitored|
        |dev_sales|Not monitored|
        |sales_dev|Monitored|
        |test|Not monitored|
        |test_sales|Not monitored|
        |sales_test|Not monitored|
        |stage|Not monitored|
        |stage_dev|Monitored|
        |dev_stage|Not monitored|
        |dbnotmon|Not monitored|
        |dbnotmon_sales|Monitored|
        |sales_dbnotmon|Monitored|

       The **Regular Expression** filtering mask type supports .NET regular expression patterns.

       :::image type="content" source="media/azure-sql-management-pack/configuring-database-exclude-regular-expression-list.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the database exclude list regular expression SQL.":::

       To remove an existing mask, select the mark, and then select **Delete**.

       For more information about any of these options and to learn how to reduce Azure subscription throttling, select the **Use T-SQL for monitoring** checkbox and see [Azure REST API monitoring vs. T-SQL monitoring](#azure-rest-api-monitoring-vs-t-sql-monitoring).

       :::image type="content" source="media/azure-sql-management-pack/selecting-spn-configuration.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the SPN configuration.":::

       When you select the **Auto-Create SPN** option, the Microsoft Azure sign-in pane appears. Enter your work, school, or personal Microsoft account credentials, and then select **Next** and complete the form.

       :::image type="content" source="media/azure-sql-management-pack/sign-in-account.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the pane to sign in to your account.":::

       At this step, an internet security alert might appear. To resolve the issue, go to **Internet Options**, select the **Security** tab, and then set a lower internet zone security level.

       :::image type="content" source="media/azure-sql-management-pack/change-security-level.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows security settings in Internet Options.":::

       When the Microsoft Entra application is successfully created, authentication information appears on **Auto-create SPN Status**.

       > [!WARNING]
       > The authentication information is available only once. Be sure to save this information to a secure location to use it later.

       :::image type="content" source="media/azure-sql-management-pack/reviewing-authentication-information.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows Authentication information.":::

1. On **Subscription Permissions**, select the Azure subscriptions where you want to add the Azure SPN. Then select **Next**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/azure-sql-management-pack/configuring-subscription-permissions.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows Subscription permissions.":::

1. On **User Management Pool**, select a pool that has management servers, and then select **Next**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/azure-sql-management-pack/selecting-management-pool.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Management pool.":::

1. On **Summary**, review the connection settings, and then select **Create**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/azure-sql-management-pack/reviewing-summary.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Summary information.":::

1. To set up T-SQL monitoring when you use Azure SPN, create a separate user for every monitored database. Grant the user the dbmanager role by running the following queries:

   ```sql
   /*Run this on [master] database.
   Replace the 'ApplicationName' parameter with that specified in the Application Name field. See figure above.*/
   CREATE USER [ApplicationName] FROM EXTERNAL PROVIDER;
   exec sp_addrolemember 'dbmanager', 'ApplicationName';

   /*Run this on all [user] databases.
   Replace the 'ApplicationName' parameter with that specified in the Application Name field. See figure above.*/
   CREATE USER [ApplicationName] FROM EXTERNAL PROVIDER;
   GRANT VIEW DATABASE STATE TO [ApplicationName];
   ```

   To run these queries in SQL Server Management Studio, connect to the Azure SQL Server instance as Administrator for Microsoft Entra.

   After you assign permissions to the Azure SPN on each database, T-SQL monitoring works in REST and T-SQL mode.

   For the correct T-SQL monitoring of geo replicas, grant the SQL Administrator right on each replica server.

## Set up T-SQL monitoring

T-SQL is intended to monitor specific Azure SQL Database servers. When you select this mode, the monitoring workflows, including discoveries, rules, and monitors, use T-SQL queries in data sources.

> [!NOTE]
> Each workflow data source creates a new SQL connection for every pair of SQL Server credentials (username and password). SQL connections are counted for database transaction units and affect billing. For more information, see [Resource limits for Azure SQL Database and Azure Synapse Analytics servers](/azure/sql-database/sql-database-resource-limits-database-server).

To monitor Azure SQL Database instances by using T-SQL queries:

1. In the System Center Operations Manager console, go to **Authoring** > **Management Pack Templates**. Right-click **Azure SQL Database Monitoring** and select **Add Monitoring Wizard**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/azure-sql-management-pack/opening-monitoring-wizard.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the T-SQL monitoring.":::

1. On **Select Monitoring Type**, select **Azure SQL Database Monitoring**, and then select **Next**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/azure-sql-management-pack/selecting-monitoring-target.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Azure SQL Database monitoring type.":::

1. On **General Properties**, enter a new name and description. For **Select destination management pack**, select a management pack to store the template. Then select **Next**.

   For **Management pack**, to create a new management pack, select **New, and follow the instructions in the wizard.

   :::image type="content" source="media/azure-sql-management-pack/configuring-general-properties.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the General settings.":::

1. On **Authentication Mode**, select **SQL Server**, and then select **Next**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/azure-sql-management-pack/selecting-authentication-sql.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the T-SQL authentication mode.":::

1. On **What to Monitor**, select **Add Server**, and then select **Next**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/azure-sql-management-pack/adding-servers.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the servers to monitor.":::

1. On **Server Configuration**, for **Server Name**, enter the name of the Azure SQL Database server that you want to monitor, select a Run As account that's associated with the SQL Server credentials, and then select **OK**. The [serveradmin](/sql/relational-databases/security/authentication-access/server-level-roles#fixed-server-level-roles) role is required.

   :::image type="content" source="media/azure-sql-management-pack/entering-server-name.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the server name.":::

   If you want to create a new Run As account, select **New**, and then enter a new Run As account name and credentials for the SQL Server instance that you want to monitor.

   For more information on how to create a new SQL Server authentication login, see [Authorize database access to SQL Database, SQL Managed Instance, and Azure Synapse Analytics](/azure/sql-database/sql-database-manage-logins).

   Select **Next**.

1. *Optionally*. on **Database Filter List**, select the filtering mode, which can be either **Exclude** or **Include**. Select a filtering mask type, which can be either **Wildcard** or **Regular Expression**. Enter filtering masks, which should match database names that you want to exclude from or include in the monitoring list. Select **Add**, and then select **Next**.

   A **Wildcard** filtering mask type can't end with `.` or space characters, can't contain `<`, `>`, `%`, `&`, `:`, `\`, `/`, `?`, or control characters, and it can't have more than 128 characters.

   :::image type="content" source="media/azure-sql-management-pack/configuring-database-include-wildcard-list-manual.png" alt-text="Screenshot that shows the Database include list wildcard SQL manual template.":::

   For example, if you select the **Exclude** option and set the *dev*, *test*, *stage*, and *dbnotmon* masks, the monitoring behavior works as described in the following table:

   |Database name|Monitored status|
   |-|-|
   |dev|Not monitored|
   |dev_sales|Not monitored|
   |sales_dev|Monitored|
   |test|Not monitored|
   |test_sales|Not monitored|
