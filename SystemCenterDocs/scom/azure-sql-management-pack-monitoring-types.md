# Monitoring Types

This section explains monitoring types that are available in Management Pack for Azure SQL Database.

## Differences Between Azure REST API and T-SQL Monitoring

The main difference between [Azure REST API](/rest/api/azure/) monitoring and T-SQL monitoring is that in T-SQL, the entire set of workflows is available, while in Azure REST API, the following workflows are disabled due to API limitations:

- Rules
  - Azure SQL DB: DB Transactions Locks Count
  - Azure SQL DB: DB Sessions Count
  - Azure SQL DB: DB Sessions Average Memory Consumption (MB)
  - Azure SQL DB: DB Sessions Rows Returned
  - Azure SQL DB: DB Sessions Total CPU Time (ms)
  - Azure SQL DB: DB Sessions Total Read/Write Operations
  - Azure SQL DB: DB Sessions Total Memory Consumption (MB)
  - Azure SQL DB: DB Transactions Max Log Usage (MB)
  - Azure SQL DB: DB Transactions Max Running Time (minutes)
  - Azure SQL DB: DB Blocked by Firewall Count
  - Azure SQL DB: DB Failed Connections Count
  - Azure SQL DB: DB Successful Connections Count
  - Azure SQL DB: DB Deadlocks Count
- Monitors
  - Transaction Locks Count
  - Sessions Count
  - Sessions Average Memory
  - Sessions Rows Returned
  - Sessions Total CPU Time
  - Sessions Total I/O
  - Sessions Total Memory
  - Transaction Log Space Used
  - Transaction Execution Time
  - Count of Failed Connection
  - Count of connections blocked by the Firewall

To enable these workflows in Azure REST API, select the **Use T-SQL monitoring** checkbox and run required T-SQL scripts provided in [Configuring Azure REST API Monitoring](#configuring-azure-rest-api-monitoring).

>[!NOTE]
> To connect System Center Operations Manager to Azure resources, your server must have TLS 1.2 enabled. Check protocol status with [TLS 1.2 enforcement for Azure AD Connect](/azure/active-directory/hybrid/reference-connect-tls-enforcement#powershell-script-to-check-tls-12).

## Configuring Azure REST API Monitoring

Azure REST API monitoring provides a wide range of monitoring targets.

When using the Azure REST API, the Azure SQL Database Management Pack utilizes an Azure AD application (that is, Service Principal Name) for authentication in Azure AD, which gives access to the Azure Resource Management API. The account that you use must have either the **Owner** role (or higher), or any of the following roles:

- **Active Directory Administrator**
- **Service Administrator** or **Co-Administrator**

For more information, see [How to - Use the portal to create an Azure AD application and service principal that can access resources](/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal).

To begin monitoring of Azure SQL Databases using the Azure REST API, perform the following steps:

1. In the System Center Operations Manager console, navigate to **Authoring | Management Pack Templates**, select and hold **Azure SQL Database Monitoring**, and select **Add Monitoring Wizard**.

    ![REST API monitoring wizard](./media/azure-sql-management-pack/opening-monitoring-wizard.png)  

2. At the **Monitoring Type** step, select **Azure SQL Database Monitoring**, and select **Next**.

    ![Monitoring target](./media/azure-sql-management-pack/selecting-monitoring-target.png)

3. At the **General Properties** step, enter a new name and description, and from the **Select destination management pack** drop-down list, select a management pack that you want to use to store the template.  

    To create a new management pack, select **New**, and follow the instructions of the wizard.

    ![General properties](./media/azure-sql-management-pack/configuring-general-properties.png)

4. At the **Authentication Mode** step, select **Azure Service Principal Name**.

    ![Authentication mode](./media/azure-sql-management-pack/selecting-authentication-mode.png)

5. At the **Azure Endpoints** step, select the **Enable checkbox if you want to change default Azure Endpoints** checkbox and modify the default Azure endpoints if required.

    The default endpoints for creating Azure Service Principal Name are as follows:

   - Authority URI: `https://login.windows.net`

   - Management Service URI: `https://management.azure.com`

     This endpoint is also used for Azure REST API. In this case, the Firewall port 443 should be used. However, according to [Ports beyond 1433 for ADO.NET 4.5](/azure/sql-database/sql-database-develop-direct-route-ports-adonet-v12), the Firewall port 1433 should be used.

   - Database Resource URI: `https://database.windows.net`

   - Graph API Resource URI: `https://graph.windows.net`

    ![Azure endpoints](./media/azure-sql-management-pack/selecting-azure-endpoints.png)

6. At the **SPN Configuration** step, choose the SPN configuration:

   - **Auto-Create SPN**

       Select this option if you want Azure Service Principal Name to be created automatically by the Azure SQL MP library using the Azure REST API. With this option selected, a new Run As Account is created with the specified Azure Service Principal Name.

   - **Use Existing Run As Profile**

       Select this option if you want to use your own Azure Service Principal Name.

   - **Enter SPN Manually**

       Select this option if you've already configured a Run As Profile (for example, in PowerShell) with the appropriate Azure Service Principal Name credentials.

    For any of these options, you can select the **Use T-SQL for monitoring** checkbox to receive additional monitoring information and neutralize Azure Subscription throttling effects. For more information, see [Differences Between Azure REST API and T-SQL Monitoring](#differences-between-azure-rest-api-and-t-sql-monitoring).

    ![SPN configuration](./media/azure-sql-management-pack/selecting-spn-configuration.png)

    If you select the **Auto-Create SPN** option, the **Microsoft Azure sign-in** window appears. In this window, enter your work, school, or personal Microsoft account credentials, select **Next**, and complete the form.

    ![Sign in to your account](./media/azure-sql-management-pack/sign-in-account.png)

    At this step, you may receive internet security alerts. To solve this, open **Internet Properties**, go to the **Security** tab, and lower the internet zone security level.

    ![Security level](./media/azure-sql-management-pack/change-security-level.png)

    Upon successful creation of the Azure AD application, at the **Auto-Create SPN Status** step, authentication information will be displayed.

    >[!TIP]
    > This information is available only once. Make sure to save this information to a secure location for reuse.

    ![Authentication information](./media/azure-sql-management-pack/reviewing-authentication-information.png)

    To perform T-SQL monitoring when using Azure Service Principal Name, create a separate user for every monitored database and grant this user the **dbmanager** role by executing the following queries:

    ```SQL
    /*Run this on [master] database.
    Replace the 'ApplicationName' parameter with that specified in the Application Name field. See figure above.*/
    CREATE USER [ApplicationName] FROM EXTERNAL PROVIDER;
    exec sp_addrolemember 'dbmanager', 'ApplicationName';

    /*Run this on all [user] databases.
    Replace the 'ApplicationName' parameter with that specified in the Application Name field. See figure above.*/
    CREATE USER [ApplicationName] FROM EXTERNAL PROVIDER;
    GRANT VIEW DATABASE STATE TO [ApplicationName];
    ```

    To run these queries in SQL Server Management Studio, connect to the Azure SQL Server as **Active Directory Administrator**.

    After you assign permissions to Azure Service Principal Name on each database, T-SQL monitoring should work properly in REST+T-SQL mode.

    For proper T-SQL monitoring of georeplicas, grant the **SQL Administrator** right on each replica server.

    At the **Subscription Permissions** step, select Azure subscriptions to which you want to add the created Azure Service Principal Name.

    ![Subscription permissions](./media/azure-sql-management-pack/configuring-subscription-permissions.png)

    To use an existing Run As Profile, at the **SPN Configuration** step, select the **Use Existing Run As Profile** option, select **Next**, and select an existing Run As Account associated with Azure Service Principal Name. This account will be used for authentication in Azure Cloud.

    ![Existing Run As Account](./media/azure-sql-management-pack/using-existing-run-as-account.png)

    If you already have an Azure Service Principal Name and want to use it to create a new Run As Account, at the **SPN Configuration** step, select the **Enter SPN Manually** option, select **Next**, and provide required information about your Azure Service Principal Name. This information will be used to create a new Run As Account for authentication in Azure Cloud.

    ![Enter SPN manually](./media/azure-sql-management-pack/entering-spn-manually.png)

    If necessary, you can create and configure a new Azure Active Directory application and Azure Service Principal Name by using [Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azure/?preserve-view=true&view=azps-2.8.0). For more information, see [How to: Use Azure PowerShell to create a service principal with a certificate](/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-authenticate-service-principal-powershell).

    Once a new Run As Account is created, at the **Enter SPN Manually Status** step, review the status and select **Next**.

    ![SPN status](./media/azure-sql-management-pack/reviewing-spn-status.png)

7. [Optionally] At the **Server Filter List** step, select filtering mode, which can be either **Exclude** or **Include**, and select filtering masks type, which can be either **Wildcard** or **Regular Expression**, enter filtering masks that should match SQL Server names that you want to exclude from or include to the monitoring list, select **Add**, and select **Next**.

    **Wildcard** filtering mask type can contain a server name only lowercase letters, numbers, and the '-' character, but can't start from or end with the '\\' character or contain more than 63 characters. A server exclude list filter mask ignores whitespaces.

    ![Screenshot of the server exclude list wildcard SPN.](./media/azure-sql-management-pack/configuring-server-include-wildcard-list.png)

    **Regular Expression** filtering mask type supports .NET regular expression patterns.

    ![Screenshot of the server exclude list regular expression SPN.](./media/azure-sql-management-pack/configuring-server-exclude-regular-expression-list.png)

    If you want to remove an existing mask, select it and select **Delete**.  

8. [Optionally] At the **Database Filter List** step, select filtering mode, which can be either **Exclude** or **Include**, and select filtering masks type, which can be either **Wildcard** or **Regular Expression**, enter filtering masks that should match database names that you want to exclude from or include to the monitoring list, select **Add**, and select **Next**.

    **Wildcard** filtering mask type can't end with '.' or ' ' characters, contain '<,>,%,&,:,\\,/,?' or control characters, and can't have more than 128 characters.

    ![Screenshot of database exclude list wildcard SPN.](./media/azure-sql-management-pack/configuring-database-include-wildcard-list.png)

    For example, if you select the **Exclude** option and set the *dev**, *\*test\**, **stageand*, *dbnotmon* masks, the monitoring behavior would be as follows:

    |DB Name|Monitored/Not monitored|
    |-|-|
    |dev|Not monitored|
    |dev_sales|Not monitored|
    |sales_dev|Monitored|
    |test|Not monitored|
    |test_sales|Not monitored|
    |sales_test|Not monitored|
    |stage|Not monitored|
    |stage_dev|Monitored|
    |dev_stage|Not monitored|
    |dbnotmon|Not monitored|
    |dbnotmon_sales|Monitored|
    |sales_dbnotmon|Monitored|

    **Regular Expression** filtering mask type supports .NET regular expression patterns.

    ![Screenshot of the database exclude list regular expression SQL.](./media/azure-sql-management-pack/configuring-database-exclude-regular-expression-list.png)

    If you want to remove an existing mask, select it and click **Delete**.

9. At the **User Management Pool** step, select a pool with management servers and select **Next**.

    ![Screenshot of the Management pool.](./media/azure-sql-management-pack/selecting-management-pool.png)

10. At the **Summary** step, review connection settings and select **Create**.

## Configuring T-SQL Monitoring

T-SQL is intended for monitoring of specific Azure SQL Database Servers. When choosing this mode, the monitoring workflows, such as discoveries, rules, and monitors use T-SQL queries in datasources.

>[!NOTE]
>Each workflow datasource creates a new SQL connection for every pair of SQL Server credentials (login\password). SQL connections are counted for database transaction units and affect the bill. For more information, see [Resource limits for Azure SQL Database and Azure Synapse Analytics servers](/azure/sql-database/sql-database-resource-limits-database-server).

To begin monitoring of Azure SQL Databases using T-SQL queries, perform the following steps:

1. In the System Center Operations Manager console, navigate to **Authoring | Management Pack Templates**, select and hold **Azure SQL Database Monitoring**, and select **Add Monitoring Wizard**.

    ![Screenshot of the T-SQL monitoring.](./media/azure-sql-management-pack/opening-monitoring-wizard.png)

2. At the **Monitoring Type** step, select **Azure SQL Database Monitoring**, and select **Next**.

    ![Screenshot of the Azure SQL monitoring type.](./media/azure-sql-management-pack/selecting-monitoring-target.png)

3. At the **General Properties** step, enter a new name and description, and from the **Select destination management pack** drop-down list, select a management pack that you want to use to store the template.  

    To create a new management pack, select **New** and follow the instructions of the wizard.

    ![Screenshot of the General settings.](./media/azure-sql-management-pack/configuring-general-properties.png)

4. At the **Authentication Mode** step, select **SQL Server**.

    ![Screenshot of the T-SQL mode.](./media/azure-sql-management-pack/selecting-authentication-sql.png)

5. At the **What to Monitor** step, select **Add Server**.

    ![Screenshot of the Servers to monitor.](./media/azure-sql-management-pack/adding-servers.png)

6. In the **Server Name** field, enter a name of the Azure SQL Database server that you want to monitor, select a Run As Account associated with the SQL Server credentials, and select **OK**. The [serveradmin](/sql/relational-databases/security/authentication-access/server-level-roles#fixed-server-level-roles) role is required.

    ![Screenshot of the Server name.](./media/azure-sql-management-pack/entering-server-name.png)

    If you want to create a new Run As Account, select **New** and enter a new Run As Account name and credentials for the SQL server that you want to monitor.

    For more information on how to create a new SQL Server authentication login, see [Authorize database access to SQL Database, SQL Managed Instance, and Azure Synapse Analytics](/azure/sql-database/sql-database-manage-logins).

7. Select **Next**.

8. [Optionally] At the **Database Filter List** step, select filtering mode, which can be either **Exclude** or **Include**, and select filtering masks type, which can be either **Wildcard** or **Regular Expression**, enter filtering masks that should match database names that you want to exclude from or include to the monitoring list, select **Add**, and select **Next**.

    **Wildcard** filtering mask type can't end with '.' or ' ' characters, contain '<,>,%,&,:,\\,/,?' or control characters, and can't have more than 128 characters.

    ![Screenshot of the Database exclude list wildcard SQL manual template.](./media/azure-sql-management-pack/configuring-database-include-wildcard-list-manual.png)

    For example, if you select the **Exclude** option and set the *dev**, *\*test\**, **stageand*, *dbnotmon* masks, the monitoring behavior would be as follows:

    |DB Name|Monitored/Not monitored|
    |-|-|
    |dev|Not monitored|
    |dev_sales|Not monitored|
    |sales_dev|Monitored|
    |test|Not monitored|
    |test_sales|Not monitored|
    |sales_test|Not monitored|
    |stage|Not monitored|
    |stage_dev|Monitored|
    |dev_stage|Not monitored|
    |dbnotmon|Not monitored|
    |dbnotmon_sales|Monitored|
    |sales_dbnotmon|Monitored|

    **Regular Expression** filtering mask type supports .NET regular expression patterns.
