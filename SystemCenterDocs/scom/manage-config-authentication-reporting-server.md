# Configure authentication for the Reporting server

Follow these steps to configure the Operations Manager Reporting server component to use algorithms that are compliant with Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) compliant. Enabling FIPS compliance for System Center 2016 - Operations Manager requires that the underlying infrastructure used (Server OS, Active Directory etc.), also be FIPS compliant.  


##  Enable FIPS on the Reporting server

To enable FIPS on the reporting server, change the configuration in the application-level Web.config file to specify that ASP.NET use the Triple Data Encryption Standard (3DES) algorithm. To do this, follow these steps.

1.	In a text editor such as Notepad, open the **Web.config** file in the **ReportManager** and **ReportServer** sub-folders under the SQL Server Reporting Services installation root folder  `C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\<InstanceName>\Reporting Services`. 

2.	In the **Web.config** file, locate the `<system.web>` section.

3.	Add the following `<machineKey>` section to in the `<system.web>` section:
`<machineKey validationKey="AutoGenerate,IsolateApps" decryptionKey="AutoGenerate,IsolateApps" validation="3DES" decryption="3DES"/>`.

4.	Save the **Web.config** file.

5.	Restart **SQL Server Reporting Services** service.

6.	Confirm SQL Server Report Manager works successfully before proceeding with the installation of the Operations Manager Report Server role.
