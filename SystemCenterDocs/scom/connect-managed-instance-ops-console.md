# Connect the Azure Monitor SCOM Managed Instance (preview) to Ops console

Azure Monitor SCOM Managed Instance (preview) is compatible with [System Center Operations Manager 2022](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=104038).

After you create the SCOM Managed Instance (preview) in Azure, connect the instance to Ops console to configure the workloads and monitor.

## Connect SCOM Managed Instance (preview) to Ops console

Follow the below steps to connect a SCOM Managed Instance (preview) to Ops console:

1. **Identify server to install Ops Console**: Identify a server where you want to install the Ops console. 
     >[!Note]
     >Don't perform this on a SCOM Managed Instance (preview) VM; do it on a separate VM. The VM needs to be a Windows Server. This server can be on-premises or on Azure.
1. **Install the Ops Console**: From the [executable file](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2212475), install the Operations console and follow the installation wizard to successfully install the Ops console.
