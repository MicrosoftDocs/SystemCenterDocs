## Prerequisites

Before you use management pack for SQL Server Replication, ensure that the environment that you use must meet the following prerequisites:

- Install **.NET Framework 4.5** or higher.

- Import both the **Management Pack for Windows Server Operating System** and the **Management Pack for SQL Server**

- Enable the **Agent Proxy** option on each agent to allow agents to forward data to management servers. For more information, see [Enable Agent Proxy Option](sql-server-management-pack-enabling-agent-proxy.md).

>[!NOTE]
>Management Pack for SQL Server Replication doesn't support most of the non-printable characters, except #x9 | #xA | #xD | [#x20-#xD7FF] | [#xE000-#xFFFD] | [#x10000-#x10FFFF], which are supported. Using unsupported non-printable characters in object names leads to inevitable workflow failure.
