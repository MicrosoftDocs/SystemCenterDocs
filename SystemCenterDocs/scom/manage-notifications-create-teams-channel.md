# How to enable Microsoft Teams notification channel in Operations Manager

This topic describes how to configure a  notification channel that will send alert notifications to subscribers by using Microsoft Teams.

Earlier, System Center - Operations Manager supported integration with *Skype for Business* that allowed the users to receive alerts from Operations Manager. All *Skype for Business* customers were encouraged to start using Microsoft Teams as their communications and collaboration service as Skype for Business was retired on July 31, 2021.

In line with the lifecycle, we now support Operations Manager alerts on Microsoft Teams (Teams).  Integration of Teams with Operations Manager enhances productivity as you can receive the Operations Manager alerts to Teams directly where you collaborate the most.

With System Center 2022, Microsoft Teams has been added to the existing basic Notification channels of Operations Manager. You can specify conditions for the channel to allow only certain types of alerts.

To configure alert notifications for Operations Manager, you must enable a notification channel. For detailed information about notification channels, see [Subscribing to alert notifications](/scom/manage-notifications-alert-notifications).

> [!NOTE]
> Integration of Operations Manager with Teams is supported for customers who use GCC, GCC High and DoD Clouds.

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- Teams tenant information.
- Run As account. Delegated API type is used in Teams integration and the Rus As account credentials will be used to authenticate.
  Run As account should be
   - A valid Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) account (sample: user@domain)
   - Licensed to use Microsoft Teams
   - A member of target Microsoft Teams channel
   - No multifactor authentication (MFA) enabled
   
  For more information see [How to create and configure the Notification action account](/system-center/scom/manage-notifications-create-configure).
- Link to the Teams channel created. For more information about Teams channels, see [Overview of Teams and channels in Microsoft Teams](/microsoftteams/teams-channels-overview).
- Details of the newly created application in Azure. Instructions to register an application available at [Register an application with the Microsoft identity platform](/graph/auth-register-app-v2).
- For the newly created App, ensure the Graph API permission is given as **ChannelMessage.Send** and **Grant admin consent for Contoso** is selected.
