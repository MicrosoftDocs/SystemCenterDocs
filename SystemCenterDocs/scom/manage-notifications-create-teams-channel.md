# How to enable Microsoft Teams notification channel

Earlier, System Center - Operations Manager supported integration with *Skype for Business* that allowed the users to receive alerts from Operations Manager. All *Skype for Business* customers were encouraged to start using Microsoft Teams as their communications and collaboration service - Skype for Business was retired on July 31, 2021.

In line with the lifecycle, we now support Operations Manager alerts on Teams.  Integration of Teams with Operations Manager enhances productivity as you can receive the Operations Manager alerts to Teams directly where you collaborate the most.

With System Center 2022, Microsoft Teams has been added to the existing basic Notification channel of Operations Manager. You can specify conditions to allow only certain types of alerts.

To configure alert notifications for Operations Manager, you must enable a notification channel. This topic describes how to configure a  notification channel that will send alert notifications to subscribers by using Microsoft Teams.

For detailed information about notification channels, see [Subscribing to alert notifications](/scom/manage-notifications-alert-notifications).

You can configure Operations Manager with Teams to send alerts through Operations console UI by providing the following details:
- Teams tenant information
- Azure SPN details
- Teams channel where you want to receive the alerts

> [!NOTE] 
> Integration of Operations Manager with Teams is supported for customers who use GCC, GCC High and DoD Clouds.

Before you begin, gather the following information:

- Teams tenant
- Teams
- Teams channel created. For more information, see [Overview of Teams and channels in Microsoft Teams](/microsoftteams/teams-channels-overview).
- Create an application in Azure or M365 Portal by following instructions on [Register an application with the Microsoft identity platform](/graph/auth-register-app-v2). 
- For the newly created App, give the following Graph API permission: **ChannelMessage.Send**.
