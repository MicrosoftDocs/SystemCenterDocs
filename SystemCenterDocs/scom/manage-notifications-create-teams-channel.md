# Set up a Microsoft Teams notification channel in System Center Operations Manager

This article describes how to set up a notification channel that sends alert notifications to subscribers by using Microsoft Teams.

Earlier versions of System Center Operations Manager supported integration with *Skype for Business*. Users could get alerts from System Center Operations Manager. All Skype for Business customers were encouraged to start using Microsoft Teams as their communications and collaboration service. Skype for Business was retired on July 31, 2021.

In line with the lifecycle, we now support System Center Operations Manager alerts on Microsoft Teams. Integrating Teams with System Center Operations Manager enhances productivity because you can get alerts directly in Teams, where you collaborate the most.

In System Center Operations Manager 2022, Microsoft Teams was added to the existing basic notification channels. You can set conditions for the channel to allow only certain types of alerts.

To configure alert notifications for System Center Operations Manager, you must enable a notification channel. For detailed information about notification channels, see [Subscribe to alert notifications](./manage-notifications-alert-notifications.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Integrating System Center Operations Manager with Teams is supported for customers who use Office 365 GCC, Office 365 GCC High, and US Department of Defense (DoD) clouds.

Before you begin, make sure that you have the following items:

- Teams tenant information.
- Run As account. The delegated API type is used in Teams integration, and the Run As account credentials are used to authenticate. The Run As account should have the following characteristics. The account is:

  - A valid Microsoft Entra ID account (for example, `user@domain`).
  - Licensed to use Microsoft Teams.
  - A member of the target Microsoft Teams channel.
  - Not enabled for multifactor authentication.

    For more information, see [Create and configure the notification action account](./manage-notifications-create-configure.md).

- Link to the Teams channel you created. For more information about Teams channels, see [Overview of teams and channels in Microsoft Teams](/microsoftteams/teams-channels-overview).
- Details of the newly created application in Azure. Instructions to register an application available at [Register an application with the Microsoft identity platform](/graph/auth-register-app-v2).
- For the newly created app, ensure that the Graph API permission is given as `ChannelMessage.Send` and that the **Grant admin consent for Contoso** checkbox is selected.
