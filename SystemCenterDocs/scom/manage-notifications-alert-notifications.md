# Subscribe to alert notifications in Operations Manager




In System Center - Operations Manager, when an alert is generated, Operations Manager can notify the designated individuals in the following modes:
- Email
- Instant message (IM)
- Text message (SMS)
- Microsoft Teams (applicable for 2022 and later)

Notifications can also run commands automatically when an alert is raised on a monitored system.  

A notification requires the following elements:  

-   A Run As account that provides credentials to the Notification Account Run As profile.  

-   A notification channel that defines the format for the notification and the method by which the notification is sent.  

-   A notification subscriber that defines the recipients and the schedule for sending notifications to the subscriber.  

-   A notification subscription that defines the criteria for sending a notification, the channel to be used, and the subscribers to receive the notification.  

An Operations Manager administrator must define the notification channels and if authentication is required, configure the Run As account for notifications. An Operations Manager administrator, advanced operator, or operator can create a subscriber and a subscription.
