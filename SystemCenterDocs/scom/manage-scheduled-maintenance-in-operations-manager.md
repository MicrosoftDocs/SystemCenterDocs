This topic details the default schedule for System Center Operations Manager maintenance tasks.  

## Maintenance Tasks Schedule  
By default, System Center Operations Manager performs maintenance tasks daily to maintain optimal performance of the Operations Manager database and data warehouse database.  These maintenance tasks are defined as system rules in the Operations Manager management pack.  

The following table displays the maintenance tasks and the time they're scheduled to run:  

|Task|Description|Schedule|  
|--------|---------------|------------|  
|Discovery Data Grooming|A rule that deletes aged discovery data from the Operations Manager database.|Every day at 2 AM|  
|Optimize Indexes|A rule that executes a daily database maintenance  stored procedure name *p_OptimizeIndexes* against some of the tables.  **This rule cannot be changed or modified.**|Every day at 2:30 AM|  
|Partition and Grooming|A rule that runs workflows to partition and deletes aged data from the Operations Manager database.|Every day at 12 AM|  
|Detect and Fix Object Space Inconsistencies|A rule that repairs data block corruption in database schema objects.|Every 30 minutes|  
|Alert Auto Resolve Execute All|A rule that automatically resolves active alerts after a period of time.|Every day at 4 AM|  
|Standard Data Warehouse Data Set maintenance rule|A rule that calls many other stored procedures to aggregate, optimize, and groom data in the data warehouse database.|Every 60 seconds|
