# Obtain a certificate for use with Windows Servers and System Center Operations Manager

This article describes how to obtain a certificate and use with Operations Manager Management Server, Gateway, or Agent using either a Stand-Alone or Enterprise Active Directory Certificate Services (AD CS) Certificate Authority (CA) server on the Windows platform.

- To request and accept a certificate, use the [certreq](/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/certreq_1) command-line utility. To submit and retrive a certificate, use a web interface.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following:

- AD-CS installed and configured in the environment with web services.
- HTTPS binding and its associated certificate installed. For information about creating an HTTPS binding, see [How to Configure an HTTPS Binding for a Windows Server CA](/system-center/scom/how-to-configure-https-binding-windows-server-ca).
- A typical desktop experience and not Core servers. 

>[!NOTE]
>
>If your organization does not using AD CS or the accompanying web services, the steps below will not apply to your environment. 

- If you are using an external certificate authority, these steps will not apply to the below scenario.

- If you have any one of these scenarios and wish to create a certificate using means outside these instructions or need the certificate specifications, ensure the certificate meets the following requirements for Operations Manager to use the certificate:

- `Subject="CN=server.contoso.com" ; (this should be the FQDN or how the system shows in DNS)`

- `[Key Usage]`
     - `Key Exportable=TRUE`
     - `HashAlgorithm = SHA256`
     - `KeyLength=2048`
     - `KeySpec=1`
     - `KeyUsage=0xf0`
     - `MachineKeySet=TRUE`

- `[EnhancedKeyUsageExtension]`
     - `OID=1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.1 ; Server Authentication`
     - `OID=1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.2 ; Client Authentication`

- `[Compatibility Settings]`
     - `Compatible with Windows Server 2003 ; (or newer based on environment)`

- `[Cryptography Settings]`
     - `Provider Category: Legacy Cryptography Service Provider`
     - `Algorithm name: RSA`
     - `Minimum Key Size: 2048 ; (2048 or 4096 as per security requirement.)`
     - `Providers: Microsoft RSA Schannel Cryptographic Provider`

>[!Important]
>For this topic, the default settings for AD-CS are as below: 
> - Standard key length: 2048
> - Microsoft Software Key Storage Provider: CSP and 
> - Secure Hash Algorithm: 256 (SHA256) 
>Evaluate these selections against the requirements of your company's security policy.

## Download and Import the Root Certificate from the CA

To trust and validate any certificates created from Enterprise or Stand-Alone CAs, the target machine needs to have a copy of the Root Certificate in its Trusted Root Store. Most domain-joined computers must trust the Enterprise CA. However, no machine will trust a certificate from a Stand-Alone CA without the Root Certificate installed.

If you are using a third-party CA, the download process will be different. However, the import process remains the same.

### Download the Trusted Root certificate from a CA

To download the Trusted Root certificate, follow these steps:

1. Log on to the computer where you want to install a certificate.
For example, *a Gateway Server or Management Server*.

2. Open a web browser and connect to the certificate server web address.
For example, *https://\<servername\>/certsrv*.

3. On the **Welcome** page, select **Download a CA Certificate**, **Certificate chain**, or **CRL**.
   
   a.	If prompted with a **Web Access Confirmation**, verify  the  server and URL, and select **Yes**.

   b. If presented with multiple options under **CA Certificate**, confirm the selection, else select the default.

4. Change the Encoding method to **Base 64** and then select **Download CA Certificate Chain**.

5. Save the certificate and provide a friendly name.

### Import the Trusted Root Certificate from the CA on the client

>[!Note]
>To import a Trusted Root Certificate, you must have administrative privileges on the target machine. 

To import the Trusted Root Certificate, follow these steps:

1. Copy the file generated in the previous step to the client.
2. Open Certificate Manager.
      1. Select Start > Run and type *mmc* to find the Microsoft Management Console (mmc.exe).
      1. Go to **File** > **Add/Remove Snap in…**.
      1. On the Add or Remove Snap-ins dialog, select **Certificates** and then select **Add**.
      1. On the Certificate Snap-in dialog,
            1. Select **Computer Account** and select **Next**. Select Computer dialog opens.
            1. Select **Local Computer** and select **Finish**.
      1. Select **OK**.
      1. From the Command Line, PowerShell, or Run, type *certlm.msc* and press **enter**.
         >[!NOTE]
         >The steps above are applicable even if certlm.msc is not found.
3. Under Console Root, expand **Certificates (Local Computer)**, expand **Trusted Root Certification Authorities**, and then select and hold Certificates.
4. Select **All Tasks**.
5. In the Certificate Import Wizard, leave the first page as default and select **Next**
      1. a.	Browse to the location where you downloaded the CA certificate file and select the trusted root certificate file copied from the CA.
      1. Select **Next**.
      1. In the Certificate Store location, leave as the default Trusted Root Certification Authorities.
      1. Select **Next** and **Finish**.
6. If successful, the Trusted Root Certificate from the CA will be visible under **Trusted Root Certification Authorities** > **Certificates**.

## Create a certificate template

**Enterprise CAs:**

 - Integrates with Active Directory Domain Services (AD-DS).
 - Publishes certificates and certificate revocation lists (CRLs) to AD-DS. 
 - Uses user accounts and security groups information that is stored in AD-DS to approve or deny certificate requests.
 - Uses certificate templates.

To issue a certificate, the Enterprise CA uses information in the certificate template to generate a certificate with the appropriate attributes for that certificate type.

**Stand-alone CAs:**

 - Don’t require AD-DS.
 - Don’t use certificate templates. 

If you use stand-alone CAs, include all the information about the requested certificate type in the certificate request.

More information, see [certificate templates](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-R2-and-2012/hh831574(v=ws.11)).

## Request a certificate using a request file

### Create a setup information (.inf) file

1. On the computer hosting the Operations Manager feature for which you are requesting a certificate, open a new text file in a text editor.

2. Create a text file containing the following content:

      ```

      [NewRequest]
      Subject=”CN=server.contoso.com”
      Key Exportable = TRUE  ; Private key is exportable
      HashAlgorithm = SHA256
      KeyLength = 2048  ; (2048 or 4096 as per Organization security requirement.)
      KeySpec = 1  ; Key Exchange – Required for encryption
      KeyUsage = 0xf0  ; Digital Signature, Key Encipherment
      MachineKeySet = TRUE
      ProviderName = "Microsoft RSA SChannel Cryptographic Provider"
      ProviderType = 12
      KeyAlgorithm = RSA

      ; Optionally include the Certificate Template for Enterprise CAs, remove the ; to uncomment
      ; [RequestAttributes]
      ; CertificateTemplate="SystemCenterOperationsManager"

      [EnhancedKeyUsageExtension]
      OID = 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.1  ; Server Authentication
      OID = 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.2  ; Client Authentication

      ```

3. Save the file with an *.inf* file extension.
For example, *CertRequestConfig.inf*.

4. Close the text editor.


### Create a Certificate request file

This process encodes the information specified in our config file in Base64 and outputs to a new file.

1. On the computer hosting the Operations Manager feature for which you are requesting a certificate, open an Administrator command prompt.

2. Navigate to the same directory where the *.inf* file is located.

3. Run the below command, modifying the *.inf* and *.req* file names as needed (leave the .req extension as-is):

      ```

      CertReq –New –f CertRequestConfig.inf CertRequest.req

      ```

4. Open the newly created file and copy the contents.

## Submit a new certificate request in the AD CS web portal using the request file

          1. Select **Next**.
          1. Provide an accessible path and recognizable file name for the certificate.
      1. Copy the newly created certificate file to the target machine.

## Install the certificate on the target machine

To use the newly created certificate, it into the certificate store on the client machine.

### Add the certificate to the Certificate Store

1. Log onto the computer where the certificates are created for Management Server, Gateway, or Agent.
2. Copy the certificate created above to an accessible location on this machine.
3. Open an Administrator Command Prompt or PowerShell window and navigate to the folder where the certificate file is located.
4. Run the below command, ensure to replace *NewCertificate.cer* with the correct name/path of the file:

      `CertReq -Accept -Machine NewCertificate.cer`

5. This certificate should now be present in the Local Machine Personal store on this computer.

Select and hold the certificate > Install > Local machine and choose the destination of the personal store to install the certificate.

>[!NOTE]
>If you add a certificate to the certificate store with the private key and delete it from the store at a later point, the certificate will no longer contain the private key when re-imported. Operations Manager communications requires private key as the outgoing data needs to be encrypted. You can repair the certificate using [certutil](/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/certutil#-repairstore), you need to provide the serial number of the cert. For example, to restore the private key, use the below command in an Administrator Command Prompt or PowerShell window:
>`certutil -repairstore my [certificateSerialNumber]`

## Import the certificate into Operations Manager  

Apart from installation of certificate on the system, you must update the Operations Manager to be aware of the certificate that you want to use. The actions below will restart the Microsoft Monitoring Agent service.

Uses the MOMCertImport.exe utility included in the **SupportTools** folder in the Operations Manager installation media. Copy the file to your server.


To import the certificate into Operations Manager using MOMCertImport, follow these steps:

1. Log on to the computer where you created the certificate.
2. Open an Administrator Command Prompt or PowerShell window and navigate to the *MOMCertImport.exe* utility folder.
3. Run the *MomCertImport.exe* utility
      1. In CMD: *MOMCertImport.exe*
      1. In PowerShell: *.\MOMCertImport.exe*
4. A GUI Window appears to **Select a Certificate**
      1. You can see a list of certificates, if you do not immediately see a list, select **More choices**.
5. From the list, select the new certificate for the machine
      1. Select **You can verify the certificate by selecting** to view the certificate properties.
6. Select **OK**
7. If successful, console displays the below message:

      `Successfully installed the certificate. Please check Operations Manager log in eventviewer to check channel connectivity.`

8. To validate, go to **Event Viewer** > **Applications and Services Logs** > **Operations Manager for an Event ID 20053**. This indicates that the authentication certificate was loaded successfully
9. If Event ID 20053 is not present on the system, look for one of these Event IDs for errors and correct accordingly:
    - 20049 
    - 20050 
    - 20052 
    - 20066 
    - 20069 
    - 20077

11. *MOMCertImport* updates this registry location to contain the value that matches the reverse of the serial number shown on the certificate:
   
      `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Microsoft Operations Manager\3.0\MachineSettings\ChannelCertificateSerialNumber`

## Renew a Certificate

The Operations Manager generates an alert when an imported certificate for Management Servers and Gateways is nearing expiration. If you receive an alert, renew or create a new certificate for the servers before the expiration date. This will only work if the certificate contains template information (from an Enterprise CA).

1. Log on to the server with the expiring certificate and launch the certificate configuration manager (*certlm.msc*).
2. Locate the expiring Operations Manager certificate.
3. If you do not find the certificate, it may’ve either been removed or imported via file and not the certificate store. You may need to issue a new certificate for this machine from the CA. Refer to the instructions above to do so.
4. If you find the certificate, below are the options to renew the cert:
      1. Request Certificate with New Key
      1. Renew Certificate with New Key
      1. Renew Certificate with Same Key
5. Select the option that best applies to what you want to do and follow the wizard.
6. Once completed, run the *MOMCertImport.exe* tool to ensure Operations Manager has the new serial number (reversed) of the certificate if it changed, see the above section for further details.

If certificate renewal via this method is not available, use the above steps to request a new certificate or with the organization’s certificate authority. Install and import the new certificate for use by the Operations Manager.

### Optional: Configure certificate auto-enrollment and renewal

Use the Enterprise CA to configure certificate auto-enrollment and renewals when they expire. This will distribute the Trusted Root certificate to all domain-joined systems. 

Configuration of certificate auto-enrollment and renewal will not work with Stand-Alone or third-party CAs. For systems in a Workgroup or separate domain, certificate renewals and enrollments will still be a manual process.


For more information, see [Windows Server guide](/windows-server/networking/core-network-guide/cncg/server-certs/configure-server-certificate-autoenrollment)

>[!Note]
>Auto-enrolment and renewal don’t configure Operations Manager to use certificates, nor does it guarantee that the certificate generated will confirm to SCOM’s Operations Manager’s expected certificate settings for auto-enrollment. However, renewals will use the same template used to create the initial certificate.
