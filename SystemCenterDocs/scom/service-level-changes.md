# Service level changes
This article details the service level changes that are required to use group Managed Service Accounts (gMSA).

>[!NOTE]
>This article is applicable for System Center 2019 UR1 - Operations Manager.


## Change service account for System Center Data Access Service to gMSA

To enable the System Center Data Access Service to use gMSA, do following:

1.	Add gMSA to the local Administrators group on the computer on which, the management server is installed, as shown in the image below.

2.	Change the existing service account for System Center Data Access Service to gMSA from the Windows Services Console as shown below:

## Change the credentials for System Center configuration service

Change the log on credentials for this service account from *Windows Services Console* as shown below:

![Configuration service](media/gmsa/configuration-service.png)

![Configuration properties](media/gmsa/configuration-properties.png)

Validate that both the services are running with gMSA.

## Change service account for SQL Server Reporting Services to gMSA
You can change the data reader account in the following two ways:

### From Windows Services Console

Change the existing service account for SQL Server Reporting Services to gMSA from the Windows Services Console as shown below:

![change service account for SQL Server](media/gmsa/change-service-account-SQL.png)

Validate that the SSRS is running with gMSA.

### From Reporting Services Configuration Manager

Select **Authentication Type** as **Service Credentials**, which is already specified as a gMSA earlier in the Reporting Services Configuration Manager.

>[!NOTE]
>SQL Server doesnâ€™t support gMSA for SSRS Execution account. Continue to use non-gMSA account for this account.


## Change the Data Warehouse Write account to use gMSA
Operations Manager stores the credentials for the Data Warehouse Write account within a Run as account, called Data Warehouse Action account.

Change the credentials of this action account to gMSA that you intend to use as Data Warehouse Write Account.

![Datawarehouse Monitoring host](media/gmsa/change-data-warehouse-write-account.png)

Validate that the *monitoringhost.exe* uses the gMSA credentials for DW Write account.

## Update the Data Warehouse database

1.	Run the following SQL Query against your Data Warehouse database. Replace *DataWarehouseName* with the name of your data Warehouse database.

    ```
    SELECT [ManagementGroupDefaultName],[WriterLoginName] FROM [DataWarehouseName].[dbo].[ManagementGroup]

    ```
2.	If the above query does not return the gMSA that you had created for the DW Write account, then execute the following query to update it:

    ```
    UPDATE [DataWarehouseName].[dbo].[ManagementGroup] SET [WriterLoginName] = 'DOMAIN\USERNAME' WHERE [ManagementGroupDefaultName] = 'SCOM MANAGEMENT GROUP NAME'
    ```
