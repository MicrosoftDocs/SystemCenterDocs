# Introduction to Management Pack for SQL Server Dashboards

Microsoft SQL Server Dashboards Management Pack provides the ability to create and customize visualization on the fly.

There are two views in SQL Server Dashboards:

- **Datacenter**-an aggregated view.

- **Instance**-provides detailed information about the selected object.

## Supported Configurations

This management pack is designed for the following versions of System Center Operations Manager:

- System Center Operations Manager 2012 R2
  
  Due to the [Lifecycle Policy](/lifecycle/products/microsoft-system-center-2012-r2-operations-manager), this version is no longer being tested.

- System Center Operations Manager 2016
- System Center Operations Manager 2019
- System Center Operations Manager 2022

A dedicated Operations Manager management group isn't required for this management pack.

The management pack consists of the following files:

- Microsoft.SQLServer.Visualization.Library.mpb
