# Install agent on Nano Server

Windows Server 2016 Nano Server is a new installation option introduced in Windows Server 2016. Nano Server is optimized for private cloud and datacenter operations. With System Center 2016  - Operations Manager you can now monitor Nano Server by installing the Operations Manager agent.

## Nano Server monitoring capabilities

With the release of Nano Server you can  monitor the basic operations of the Server by using the Windows Server Operating System Management Pack.  You can also monitor a Nano Server running the following workloads:

- Windows Failover Cluster  
- Domain Name System (DNS) server
- Internet Information Services (IIS)

You can download these management packs for Nano Server from the [Microsoft Download Center](https://www.microsoft.com/download).  

Monitoring a Nano Server installation is similar to monitoring any other installation of Windows Server, however, there are some key differences in how you install the agent on a Nano Server.

You will need to follow the steps listed below to start monitoring a Nano Server.

1.  [Deploy the Operations Manager agent from the Operations console using the Discovery Wizard](~/scom/manage-deploy-windows-agent-console.md) or [Manually install the Operations Manager agent on a Nano server](#manually-install-the-operations-manager-agent-on-a-nano-server).

2.  [Validate that the Operations Manager agent has been successfully installed](#validate-that-the-operations-manager-agent-has-been-successfully-installed)

3.  [Process Manual Agent Installations](manage-deploy-windows-agent-manually.md) if you installed the agent manually on Nano Server.

4.  [Verify that you are monitoring your Nano Server](#verify-that-you-are-monitoring-your-nano-server).

There are several limitations in this release of the Nano Server agent. The following operations are not supported in this release:

-   Installing the Operations Manager Agent via an MSI package.

-   Monitoring a Nano Server that is not in the same domain as the Operations Manager Management Server.

-   Monitoring a Nano Server with a Management Pack written in VBScript or JScript.

-   Monitoring .Net applications running on a Nano Server.

-   Process Monitoring on the Nano Server.

-   ICMP monitoring on the Nano Server.

-   OLE DB monitoring on the Nano Server.

-   Integrating the Nano Server with Active Directory.

-   Updating the Operations Manager agent on a Nano Server by applying updates.

-   Using network discovery rules to discover devices that support ICMP.

-   Monitoring specific URL's on a Nano Server.

-   Collecting data from the Application Log of a Nano Server.

-   Putting a Nano Server into maintenance mode.


## Manually install the Operations Manager agent on a Nano server

1.  Follow the instructions for manually installing Nano Server on either a physical computer or a virtual machine. See [Getting Started with Nano Server](/windows-server/get-started/getting-started-with-nano-server) for complete instructions.

    > [!NOTE]
    > The Nano Server must be in the same domain as the Operations Manager Management Server.

2.  Add the Microsoft-OneCore-ReverseForwarders package as described in the Getting Started with Nano Server topic.

3.  Join the Nano Server to the same domain as the  Operations Manager Management Server.
There are two methods available for installing the Operations Manager agent on Nano Servers, Discovery Wizard from the Operations console or PowerShell script.  The process of installing the agent using the Discovery Wizard is consistent with the steps described in the following document [Discover and install agent on Windows](~/scom/manage-deploy-windows-agent-console.md).

Use the following procedure to install the agent with a PowerShell script.   

1. Copy the NanoServer directory from the System Center Operations Manager setup directory to the Nano Server.

2. Open a PowerShell command window on the Nano Server from a computer running in the same domain as the Nano Server.

3. Set the file path on the Nano Server to NanoAgent\NanoServer

4. Run the following script:

   ```
   .\InstallNanoServerScomAgentOnline.ps1 -ManagementServerFQDN <Management Server Name FQDN> -ManagementGroupName <Management Group Name> -NanoServerFQDN <FQDN of target Nano Server> -BinaryFolder ..\
   ```

   > [!NOTE]
   > If the installation is successful you will see "Installation successful" in the Installlog.txt file which the installer will add to the NanoAgent\NanoServer directory on the Nano Server. You should not see any errors in that file.

5. Run the following command on the Nano Server:

   ```
   Net Start HealthService
   ```

## Installing updates to the Nano agent

The Nano agent can be updated by one of the following methods:

1. Push updates from a management server.  

    Updates are offered and installed automatically from Microsoft Update to an Operations Manager management server. With Operations Manager 2016, the management server updates will also include the updated files for Nano agent.  

    After the management server is upgraded, the Nano agents will be placed in a pending management state, as described in the [process manual agent installations](~/scom/manage-deploy-windows-agent-manually.md) topic. After approving updates, the agents will receive and apply the update.  Alternatively, you can trigger repair from the Operations console on any Nano agent. This will cause the update to be pushed and installed on the Nano agent from the management server.

2. Manually install update

    Updates to the Nano agent are available for download by following the instructions in the KB article and applying the update manually. You can install these downloaded updates on a Nano agent machine using the following Powershell script.  

    ```powershell
      .\UpdateNanoServerScomAgentOnline.ps1 -NanoServerFQDN <FQDN of target Nano Server> -BinaryFolder <<Path where the update .cab is already expanded OR path to one or more Nano-agent update .cab files> -IsCabExpanded <$true if BinaryFolder path is to an expanded .cab, $false if it is for a packed .cab file(s)> -RemoveBackup <$true to remove the previous binaries from the agent machine>
    ```

    For System Center 2016 - Operations Manager RTM, you can download the Nano Agent cab file from the [Microsoft Download Center](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=54767&WT.mc_id=rss_windows_allproducts).  

### Uninstalling updates from the Nano Agent

Directly uninstalling the most recent update from the Nano agent is not supported. Instead, you should uninstall the agent completely and reinstall the agent with the desired set of updates.
