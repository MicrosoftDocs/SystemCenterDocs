# Management Pack for Azure SQL Managed Instance Delivery

You can download Management Pack for Azure SQL Managed Instance from the [Microsoft portal](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=101203) or System Center Operations Manager Online Catalog.

After you download and unpack the **Microsoft.Azure.ManagedInstance.ManagementPack.msi** packageâ€”a set of MP and MPB files for monitoring of Azure SQL Managed Instance, the following files become available: 

- Microsoft.Azure.ManagedInstance.Discovery.mpb
- Microsoft.Azure.ManagedInstance.Monitoring.mpb
- Microsoft.Azure.ManagedInstance.Views.</i>mp
- Microsoft.SQLServer.Core.Library.mpb
- Microsoft.SQLServer.Visualization.Library.mpb

## Prerequisites

The environment that you use must meet the following prerequisites before you start using Management Pack for Azure SQL Managed Instance:

- Install **.NET Framework 4.6.1** or higher on all management servers participating in managed instance monitoring.

- Provide access to managed instances from management servers.

    Managed instances are usually deployed to an isolated private network. This means that there should be a permanent VPN connection configured on servers from which the managed instances should be accessed. 

>[!NOTE]
>Management Pack for Azure SQL Managed Instance does not support most of the non-printable characters, except #x9 | #xA | #xD | [#x20-#xD7FF] | [#xE000-#xFFFD] | [#x10000-#x10FFFF], which are supported. Using unsupported non-printable characters in object names leads to inevitable workflow failure.
