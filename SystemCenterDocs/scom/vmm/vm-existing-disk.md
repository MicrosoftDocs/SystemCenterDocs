# Deploy VMs in the VMM fabric from an existing virtual hard disk




This article describes how to create and deploy virtual machines in the System Center - Virtual Machine Manager (VMM) fabric, from an existing virtual hard disk (VHD).


## Before you start

- To complete the steps you must be an Administrator or Delegated Administrator on the VMM server, or a self-service user.
- If you're a self-service user you need **Deploy** permissions with the **Store and re-deploy** action assigned. You must first deploy the VM to a private cloud, and then store it in the library.
- The VHD you want to use must be stored in the VMM library. [Learn more](library-files.md)
- Use a VHD that has been generalized using Sysprep. If you don't the identity of the cloned VM will be the same as the source VM, and issues might occur if you turn them on together.

## Create a VM

1.  Click **VMs and Services** > **Create Virtual Machine** > **Create Virtual Machine**.
2. In **Create Virtual Machine Wizard** > **Select Source**, click **Use an existing virtual machine, VM template, or virtual hard disk** > **Browse**. Select an existing VHD.
3. In **Identity**, specify the VM name and an optional description. If the VHD you choose is in the .vhdx format, in the **Generation** box, select **Generation 1** or **Generation 2**. Then click **Next**.
4. In **Configure Hardware**, either select the profile that you want to use from the **Hardware profile** list, or configure the hardware settings manually. The hardware setting displayed will differ depending on whether you're deploying a generation 1 or generation 2 machine. Then click **Next**.

    -   In **Compatibility**, if you want to deploy the virtual machine to a private cloud, select a capability profile that is available to the private cloud.

    -   In **Bus Configuration**, if you want to install an operating system from a DVD or an .iso image, ensure there is a virtual DVD drive that is configured to use an available option such as the **Existing ISO image file** option. If you want to use an ISO image file, the file must be present in the VMM library.
    -   If you want to store the virtual machine in the VMM library before you deploy it to a host, use of one of the blank virtual hard disks that are provided by default in the VMM library. Click the VHD in **Bus Configuration**. Click **Use an existing virtual hard disk** > **Browse** and select a blank hard disk
    -   If the virtual machine is a generation 1 that boots from the network to install an operating system, in **Network Adapters**, use the legacy network adapter type.

5.  In **Select Destination** page, specify how the virtual machine should be deployed - in a private cloud, on a host, or stored in the library.



## Deploy the VM in a private cloud

1.  In **Select Cloud** select the private cloud on which you want to place the virtual machine. If you are connected as an Administrator, you can select the host on which the virtual machine should be deployed in the private cloud. Cloud suggestions are based on a 0-5 star rating. [Learn more](provision-vms.md#vm-placement). Verify the settings and modify if required:

    -   **Expected utilization**: Expected utilization for a VM created from a blank VHD is based on standard defaults. VMM updates host suggestions and ratings in response to modifications made to the expected virtual machine utilization.
    -   **Make this VM highly available**: With this option selected, only hosts that are located in a cluster are available for selection.
    -   **Details**: Indicates the status of the host, the operating system, and the type and status of the virtualization software.
    -   **Rating Explanation**: Provides an explanation if a host received a zero rating.
    -   **SAN Explanation** or **Deployment and Transfer Explanation**: Lists any factors that make a storage area network (SAN) transfer unavailable. VMM does not recognize a virtual machine that is stored on a SAN as available for deployment by using SAN transfer if the virtual machine was stored directly in the library when it was created or was added to the library during a library refresh. To avoid this issue, deploy the virtual machine to a host by using a LAN transfer, and then store the virtual machine in the same VMM library, library share, and logical unit number (LUN).
    - The **Deployment and Transfer Explanation** tab provides an explanation if fast file copy cannot be used. Fast file copy is based on the Windows Offloaded Data Transfers (ODX). [Learn more](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/hh831628.aspx).

2.  In **Configure Settings**, review the VM settings. Either accept the default VM path on the host or specify a different location. you can optionally select to **Add this path to the list of default virtual machine paths on the host**. In **Machine Resources** accept the default values for the VHD, or modify as required. To prevent placement from choosing its own values, click the pin icon next to the setting. This option isn't available for self-service users.
3.  In **Select Networks**, if it appears, optionally select the network settings, and click **Next**.
4.  In **Add Properties**, configure the action to take when the host starts or stops, and the operating system that you will install on the VM. Then click **Next.**
5.  In **Summary**, confirm the settings, and click **Create**. Confirm that the VM was created in **VMs and Services** > **Clouds**, and select the cloud. The virtual machine appears in the **VMs** pane.

## Deploy the VM on a host

1. In **Select Host**, view the ratings, click the host on which you want to deploy the VM, and click **Next**. The host suggestions are based on a 0-5 star rating. [Learn more](provision-vms.md#vm-placement). Verify the settings and modify if required:

    -   **Expected utilization**: Expected utilization for a VM created from a blank VHD is based on standard defaults. VMM updates host suggestions and ratings in response to modifications made to the expected virtual machine utilization.
    -   **Make this VM highly available**: With this option selected, only hosts that are located in a cluster are available for selection.
    -   **Details**: Indicates the status of the host, the operating system, and the type and status of the virtualization software.
    -   **Rating Explanation**: Provides an explanation if a host received a zero rating.
    -   **SAN Explanation** or **Deployment and Transfer Explanation**: Lists any factors that make a storage area network (SAN) transfer unavailable. VMM does not recognize a virtual machine that is stored on a SAN as available for deployment by using SAN transfer if the virtual machine was stored directly in the library when it was created or was added to the library during a library refresh. To avoid this issue, deploy the virtual machine to a host by using a LAN transfer, and then store the virtual machine in the same VMM library, library share, and logical unit number (LUN).

3. In **Select Networks**, if it appears, optionally select the network settings, and click **Next**.
4. In **Add Properties**, configure the action to take when the host starts or stops, and the operating system that you will install on the VM. Then click **Next.**
5. In **Summary**, confirm the settings, and then click **Create**.


## Store the VM in the library

1.  In **Select Library Server**, click the library server that you want to use, and then click **Next**.
2.  In **Select Path**, specify the library share location to store the virtual machine. Click **Browse** to select a library share and an optional folder location, click **OK**, and then click **Next**.
3.  In **Summary** confirm the settings, and then click **Create**.
4.  To confirm that the virtual machine was created, in the **Library** workspace, in the **Library** pane, expand **Library Servers**, expand the library server where you stored the virtual machine, and then click **Stored Virtual Machines and Services**. The stored virtual machine appears in the **Physical Library Objects** pane.
