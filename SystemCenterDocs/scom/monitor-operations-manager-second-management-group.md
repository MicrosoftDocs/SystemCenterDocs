# Monitoring Operations Manager from a second management group

Businesses using System Center â€“ Operations Manager in multiple management groups might monitor one management group from another management group. This topic provides the steps for monitoring one management group (management group A) from a second management group (management group B).

## Steps to monitor from second management group

- Install an agent on management servers in management group A from management group B. If you install the agent manually, configure the agent to report to a management server in management group B.
- Disable Active Directory integration for the agent you install on the management server in management group A.
- To upgrade the management server in management group A, you must remove the management group B agent first.
- After the agent is installed, ensure that you do not configure the agent to also report to management group A ("multihome" the agent).
- Ensure that the Run As accounts for the Default Action Account and Privileged Monitoring Account profiles for the management server in management group B are using credentials that can remotely authenticate and that have sufficient permissions on the management servers in management group A.
