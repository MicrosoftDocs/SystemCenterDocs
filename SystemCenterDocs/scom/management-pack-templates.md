_Management Pack Templates_ provide _Monitoring wizards_ that let you create complete monitoring scenarios with minimal input. The wizard creates the required monitors, rules, and even targets to implement the particular scenario. There's no requirement for you to understand the management pack elements that are created. You can modify the configuration of the wizard itself if you want to change the way that monitoring is being performed.

If a management pack template is available for your particular monitoring requirement, using the template most likely is your best strategy. In many cases, you could create the individual rules and monitors yourself, but this exercise is more complex than using an available template. In addition, some templates perform actions that you can't perform in any other way in the Operations console.

The following table lists the management pack templates that are part of the standard Operations Manager installation. You can install other management packs that might provide additional templates. Each of these templates is covered in detail in the subsequent sections of this article.
