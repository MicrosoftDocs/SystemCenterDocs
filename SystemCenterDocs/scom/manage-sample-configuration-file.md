# Sample configuration file for collecting Linux log files

This article details a sample configuration for collecting log files from Linux with System Center Operations Manager.

## Sample configuration

```
# Have a source directive for each log file source file.
<source>

    # Fluentd input tail plugin, will start reading from the tail of the log

    type tail

    # Specify the log file path. This supports wild card character
    path /root/demo/log/demo*.log

    # This is recommended - Fluentd will record the position it last read into this file. Change this folder according to your server
    #pos_file PATH /home/user1/fluent-test/demo_simple_match.log.pos

    # tag is used to correlate the directives. For example, source with corresponding filter and match directives.
    tag scom.log

    #reads the  fields from the log file in the specified format
    format /(?<message>.*)/

</source>

<source>
    # Fluentd input tail plugin, will start reading from the tail of the log
    type tail

    # Specify the log file path.
    path /var/log/mongodb/mongod.log

    # tag is used to correlate the directives.
    tag  scom.mongo.log

    #reads the  fields from the log file in the specified format

    format /(?<timestamp>[^ ]*) (?<severity>[A-Z]) (?<component>(-|([^ ]*)))\s* \[(?<context>[^\]]*)\] ((?<query>.*) (?<querytime_ms>[\d\.]+(?=ms))|(?<message>.*))/
    </source>

<source>
    # Fluentd input tail plugin, will start reading from the tail of the log
    type tail

    # Specify the log file path. This supports wild card character
    path /var/log/syslog

    # This is recommended - Fluentd will record the position it last read into this file
    #pos_file /home/user1/fluent-test/demo_syslog.log.pos

    # tag is used to correlate the directives. For example, source with corresponding filter and match directives.
    tag scom.log.syslog

    format /(?<message>.*)/

</source>

<source>

    type tail

                    # Log file that needs to be monitored
    path /var/log/mongodb/mongod.log

                    # tag to correlate with filter and match directives
    tag  scom.log.mongo

    # reads the following fields from the log file
    format /(?<timestamp>[^ ]*) (?<severity>[A-Z]) (?<component>(-|([^ ]*)))\s* \[(?<context>[^\]]*)\] ((?<query>.*) (?<querytime_ms>[\d\.]+(?=ms))|(?<message>.*))/
