# How to Install the Operations console



After you install System Center - Operations Manager, you can install the Operations console on other servers and computers. For example, you might want to view monitoring data from your desktop computer.

You must ensure that the computer that will host the Operations console meets the minimum system requirements. For more information, see [System Requirements for System Center - Operations Manager](./system-requirements.md)

## Install the Operations console

Follow these steps to install the Operations console:

1.  Sign in to the computer that will host the Operations console with an account that has local administrative credentials.

2.  On the Operations Manager installation media, run **Setup.exe**, and select **Install**.

3.  On the **Getting Started**, **Select features to install** page, select **Operations console**. To read more about what each feature provides and its requirements, select **Expand all**, or expand the buttons next to each feature, and select **Next**.

4.  On the **Getting Started**, **Select installation location** page, accept the default location or enter a new location or browse to one, and select **Next**.

5.  On the **Prerequisites** page, review and address any warnings or errors that the Prerequisites checker returns, and select **Verify Prerequisites Again**.

6.  If the Prerequisite checker returns no warnings or errors, the **Prerequisites**, **Proceed with Setup** page appears. Select **Next**.

7.  On the **Configuration**, **Help improve System Center - Operations Manager** page, select your options, and select **Next**.

8.  If Windows Update isn't enabled on the computer, the **Configuration**, **Microsoft Update** page appears. Select your options, and select **Next**.

9. Review the options on the **Configuration**, **Installation Summary** page, and select **Install**. Setup continues.

10. When the Setup is finished, the **Setup is complete** page appears. Select **Close**, and the Operations console opens.

11. In the Operations console, on the **Connect to Server** page, enter the name of the first management server that you installed in the management group in the **Server name** box, and select **Connect**.
