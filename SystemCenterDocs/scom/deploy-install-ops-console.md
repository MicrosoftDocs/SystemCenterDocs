# How to Install the Operations console

After you install System Center - Operations Manager, you can install the Operations console on other servers and computers. For example, you might want to view monitoring data from your desktop computer.

You must ensure that the computer that will host the Operations console meets the minimum system requirements. For more information, see [System Requirements for System Center - Operations Manager](plan-system-requirements.md)

## To install the Operations console

1.  Log on to the computer that will host the Operations console with an account that has local administrative credentials.

2.  On the Operations Manager installation media, run **Setup.exe**, and then click **Install**.

3.  On the **Getting Started**, **Select features to install** page, select **Operations console**. To read more about what each feature provides and its requirements, click **Expand all**, or expand the buttons next to each feature, and then click **Next**.

4.  On the **Getting Started**, **Select installation location** page, accept the default location, or type a new location or browse to one, and then click **Next**.

5.  On the **Prerequisites** page, review and address any warnings or errors that the Prerequisites checker returns, and then click **Verify Prerequisites Again**.

6.  If the Prerequisite checker returns no warnings or errors, the **Prerequisites**, **Proceed with Setup** page appears. Click **Next**.

7.  On the **Configuration**, **Help improve System Center - Operations Manager** page, select your options, and then click **Next**.

8.  If Windows Update is not enabled on the computer, the **Configuration**, **Microsoft Update** page appears. Select your options, and then click **Next**.

9. Review the options on the **Configuration**, **Installation Summary** page, and then click **Install**. Setup continues.

10. When Setup is finished, the **Setup is complete** page appears. Click **Close**, and the Operations console opens.

11. In the Operations console, on the **Connect to Server** page, type the name of the first management server that you installed in the management group in the **Server name** box, and then click **Connect**.

## To install the Operations console from the Command Prompt 

1.  Log on to the server by using an account that has local administrative credentials.

2.  Open the Command Prompt window by using the **Run as Administrator** option.
