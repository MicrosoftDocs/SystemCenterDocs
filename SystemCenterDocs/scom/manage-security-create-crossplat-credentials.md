# How to set credentials for Accessing UNIX and Linux computers

This topic contains procedures for how to set credentials in wizards for the following tasks, as set by wizards in System Center - Operations Manager:  

-  Credentials for Installing Agents  
-  Credentials for Run As Accounts  
-  Credentials for Upgrading an Agent  
-  Credentials for Uninstalling an Agent

These wizards define credentials to be authenticated on the UNIX or Linux computer and follow a similar process. For an overview of how credentials are provided, see [Planning Security Credentials for Accessing Unix and Linux Computers](plan-security-crossplat-credentials.md).  

## Credentials for discovering UNIX and Linux computers  

The following procedure begins in **Computer and Device Management Wizard**, on the **Discovery Criteria** page, when you click the **Set Credentials** button. For more information, see [Install Agent on UNIX and Linux Using the Discovery Wizard](~/scom/manage-deploy-crossplat-agent-console.md).  

### To set a user (unprivileged) account for discovery of an installed agent with a signed certificate.  

1.  On the **Credential Settings**page, click the **Default Credentials** tab, and then click the **Password** option.  

2.  Type a user name, a password, and the password confirmation.  

3.  In the **Does this account have privileged access** list, click **This account does not have privileged access**, and then click **OK**.  

4.  Click **OK** to return to the **Discovery Criteria** page and continue with the wizard.  

## Credentials for installing agents or signing certificates of installed agents
