This article contains procedures for how to set credentials in wizards for the following tasks, as set by wizards in System Center - Operations Manager:  

-  Credentials for Installing Agents  
-  Credentials for Run As Accounts  
-  Credentials for Upgrading an Agent  
-  Credentials for Uninstalling an Agent

These wizards define credentials to be authenticated on the UNIX or Linux computer and follow a similar process. For an overview of how credentials are provided, see [Planning Security Credentials for Accessing Unix and Linux Computers](plan-security-crossplat-credentials.md).  

## Credentials for discovering UNIX and Linux computers  

The following procedure begins in **Computer and Device Management Wizard**, on the **Discovery Criteria** page, when you select the **Set Credentials** button. For more information, see [Install Agent on UNIX and Linux Using the Discovery Wizard](~/scom/manage-deploy-crossplat-agent-console.md).  

### To set a user (unprivileged) account for discovery of an installed agent with a signed certificate.  

1.  On the **Credential Settings**page, select the **Default Credentials** tab, and then select the **Password** option.  

2.  Enter a user name, a password, and the password confirmation.  

3.  In the **Does this account have privileged access** list, select **This account does not have privileged access**, and select **OK**.  

4.  Select **OK** to return to the **Discovery Criteria** page and continue with the wizard.  

## Credentials for installing agents or signing certificates of installed agents  

The following procedures begin in the **Computer and Device Management Wizard**, on the **Discovery Criteria** page, when you select the **Set Credentials** button.
