# Data driven alert management

To drive towards improved accuracy of issues detected and alerted for infrastructure services and application monitored by System Center - Operations Manager, the Tune Management Packs feature is available to highlight the management packs and its workflows, which generate a high volume of alerts.  

You can now get better visibility into the alerts generated in your environment through the console, instead of running reports or using custom scripts to expose this data. For monitors and rules from a management pack that generate a significant volume of alerts, you can directly review the configuration of the rule or monitor. You can see which monitored objects generate the alert volume, or modify its configuration by setting an override without needing to go to the Monitoring or Authoring view.  

By default, the view is scoped to present 30 or more alerts that the past 90 days.

## Review alerts to tune

1. Sign in to the computer with an account that's a member of the Operations Manager Administrators role.

2. In the Operations console, select **Administration**.

3. In the navigation pane, select **Tune Management Packs** under **Management Packs**.

4. This view gives you an overall picture of the alerts generated (by alert count) by management packs in your management group for the specified duration.

5. To get more information on a specific management pack, select that management pack. This action enables the **Properties** and **Tune Alerts** actions in the **Tasks** pane.    

6. To review properties of the selected management pack, select **Properties** from the **Tasks** pane. The **Management Pack General Properties** dialog appears for the specified management pack.    

7. To review additional information for the alerts generated by the selected management pack, select **Tune Alerts** from the **Tasks** pane. The **Alerts** view window appears, which displays the following properties for each alert type:

    - Alert Name - the alert display name from rule or monitor that generated the alert  
    - Count - how many alerts were created over the period of time by the rule or monitor  
    - Severity - indicates the degree of impact based on the issue identified  
    - Priority - indicates how quickly to respond in order to resolve the issue identified   
    - Monitor / Rule - indicates if the alert was generated by a rule or monitor  
    - Monitor / Rule Name - the name of the monitor or rule that generated the alert  

8. For each alert type, you can select **View or Edit settings of this monitor**, **View or Edit settings of this rule**, **View or Override Sources**, or **Overrides** action from the **Tasks** pane.    

Selecting **View or Edit settings of this monitor** or **View or Edit settings of this rule** opens the properties dialog of the particular alert type selected.  

If you want more information on the different sources that generate multiple alerts for a specific alert type, select **View or Override Source**. This action opens a dialog that displays the different sources that generate a specific alert along with the count for each source. In this view, you can understand which source or sources are generating a lot of alerts. From here, you can disable the monitor or rule, override a specific parameter for that monitored object, or view the overrides already configured for that workflow.  

If you need to configure the override against a different target, select **Overrides**, and target the configuration change against **all objects of class**, a **group**, **objects of another class**, **specific object of class**, or **objects of another class**. The override functionality and the **View or Edit settings of monitor or rule** are consistent in behavior with the other methods you can apply overrides in the console.  

The alert level information and the source level information provide you with more insight into the alerts being generated in your environment. By using the other methods available in Operations Manager to evaluate alert volume, you can determine where you need to make further changes to improve monitoring and alert accuracy.

## Change view settings

The following procedure describes how to configure the frequency and the minimum number of alerts to filter in the Tune Management Packs view.

1. Sign in to the computer with an account that's a member of the Operations Manager Administrators role.

2. In the Operations console, select **Administration**.

3. In the navigation pane, select **Tune Management Packs** under **Management Packs**.

4. From the **Actions** pane, select **Identify Management Packs to Tune**.

5. In the **Identify Management Packs to Tune** dialog, complete the following steps:

    - Specify the date and time range by typing it manually in the **Display alerts from** and **To** fields, or use the Date and Time control to modify the date range.  
    - Specify the minimum number of alerts generated by workflows in a management pack that you want to see by entering a number.  

6. In the **Identify Management Packs to Tune** dialog, select **OK** to save your changes.
