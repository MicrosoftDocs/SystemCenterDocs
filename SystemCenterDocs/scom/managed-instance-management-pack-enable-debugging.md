# Debugging in Azure SQL Managed Instance Management Pack 

In Management Pack for Azure SQL Managed Instance, you can enable debugging in the Windows Event log in cases where you want to investigate potential issues that may occur during monitoring or see the detailed data sets used in the management pack workflows.

## Enabling debugging

To enable debugging, follow these steps on the computer running System Center Operations Manager or another server that collects Azure SQL Managed Instance events:

1. Open the Windows registry.

2. Create the following key:
`HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Microsoft Operations Manager\3.0\SQL Management Packs\EnableEvtLogDebugOutput\Azure SQL MI MP`

3. Create a Multi-String with the name `<Management Group Name>` that corresponds to the management group name for which you want to collect logs. Fill the **Value** field with the value "1" to enable module debugging.

Or use the following PowerShell script to enable debugging in automated mode:

```PowerShell
$SCOMRoot = 'HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Microsoft Operations Manager\3.0\'
$MPDebugKey = Join-Path -Path $SCOMRoot -ChildPath 'SQL Management Packs\EnableEvtLogDebugOutput\Azure SQL MI MP'
$AgRoot = Join-Path -Path $SCOMRoot -ChildPath 'Agent Management Groups'
$SrvRoot = Join-Path -Path $SCOMRoot -ChildPath 'Server Management Groups'
$searchPath = if (Test-Path $AgRoot) { $AgRoot } else { $SrvRoot }

if (-not(Test-Path $SCOMRoot)) {
    Write-Error 'The Microsoft Operations Manager or Monitoring Agent is not installed.' -ErrorAction Stop
}

if (-not(Test-Path $MPDebugKey)) {
    New-Item -Path $MPDebugKey -Force | Out-Null
}

Get-ChildItem -Path $searchPath |
Out-GridView -OutputMode Multiple | # Remove this line if there is no need for GUI
ForEach-Object {
    New-ItemProperty -LiteralPath $MPDebugKey -Name $_.PSChildName -Value '1' -PropertyType 'MultiString' -Force | Out-Null
}
```

The same should be done for each Operations Manager or Monitoring Agent where extended logging must be enabled. You don't need to restart any service; changes are applied automatically.

## Disabling Debugging

To disable debugging, delete the keys added above or use the following PowerShell script to disable debugging in automated mode:

```PowerShell
$MPDebugKey = 'HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Microsoft Operations Manager\3.0\SQL Management Packs\EnableEvtLogDebugOutput\Azure SQL MI MP'

if (-not(Test-Path $MPDebugKey)) {
    Write-Error 'The Microsoft Operations Manager or Monitoring Agent is not installed.' -ErrorAction Stop
}

(Get-Item -Path $MPDebugKey).property |
Out-GridView -OutputMode Multiple | # Remove this line if there is no need for GUI
ForEach-Object {
    Remove-ItemProperty -LiteralPath $MPDebugKey -Name $_ -Force | Out-Null
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, you can enable extended logging for all SQL MP modules only. Extended logging of separate modules isn't supported yet.
