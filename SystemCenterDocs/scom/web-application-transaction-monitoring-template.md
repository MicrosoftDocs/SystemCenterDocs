The _Web Application Transaction Monitoring_ template lets you test a website or web-based application by sending requests over HTTP, validating their response, and measuring their performance. This can be a simple test to determine if the website is responding, or it can be a complex set of requests to simulate a user who is performing such actions as signing in to the site and browsing through a set of pages.

The HTTP requests are sent from one or more [Watcher Nodes](/previous-versions/system-center/system-center-2012-R2/hh457584%28v%3dsc.12%29). The website that's being monitored can reside on any computer whether it has an agent for Operations Manager installed. It can be an external website, but it must be accessible from the watcher nodes. Each watcher node must have an Operations Manager agent installed.

## Scenarios

Use the  **Web Application Transition Monitoring**  template for monitoring the availability and performance of any website or web-based application to test both general availability and functionality. For internal websites, you can use watcher nodes in different network segments to ensure that the site is available to each segment.

In addition to general availability, you can check the functionality of the website by testing different pages and features. For example, you could check a sign-in process by performing a test sign-in with a test user account every few minutes. You could test the functionality of a search page by performing a sample search after the test user account is signed in. You can then analyze the HTML that's returned from these pages to verify whether the page functioned as expected. In addition to testing this functionality, you can analyze the time it takes to fill the request to measure the performance.
