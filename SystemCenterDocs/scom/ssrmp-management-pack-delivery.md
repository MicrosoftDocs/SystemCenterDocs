## Prerequisites

The environment that you use must meet the following prerequisites before you start using Management Pack for SQL Server Replication:

- Install **.NET Framework 4.5** or higher.

- Import both the **Management Pack for Windows Server Operating System** an the **Management Pack for SQL Server**

- Enable the **Agent Proxy** option on each agent to allow agents to forward data to management servers.
  
  This option should be enabled in cases when the agent workflow scenarios discover any non-hosted objects created by the management pack for each SQL Server instance. For more information on how to enable this option, see [Enabling Agent Proxy Option](ssrmp-management-pack-configuration.md#enabling-agent-proxy-option)
