# Security Configuration in Management Pack for SQL Server Analysis Services

By default, all discoveries and monitors configured in [Management Pack for SQL Server](sql-server-management-pack-supported-configuration.md) use accounts defined in the **Default Action Account** Run As profile.

If the default action account for the given system does not have necessary permissions to discover and monitor instances of SQL Server Analysis Services, those systems can be bound to more specific credentials in **Microsoft SQL Server** Run As profiles.

>[!NOTE]
>This management pack does not support least-privilege monitoring configurations and requires an action account to be a local administrator on SSAS servers.

## Default Run As Profiles

After importing the management pack, the following default Run As profiles are created:

- **Microsoft SQL Server Discovery Run As Profile**

    This profile is associated with discoveries:

    - Multidimensional DB
    - Multidimensional Instance
    - Multidimensional Partition
    - PowerPivot Instance
    - Tabular DB
    - Tabular Instance

- **Microsoft SQL Server Monitoring Run As Profile**

    This profile is associated with monitors and rules:

    - Monitors

        - Blocking Session Count
        - CPU Utilization (%)
        - Database Free Space

## SQL Server and SQL Server Analysis Services Run As Profiles

To use separate accounts for monitoring of DB Engine, SSRS, and SSAS, create 3 different Windows accounts, and configure each account in each Run As profile according to the following table.

|Monitoring Account|[Association] Used for|
|-|-|
|SQL Server DB Monitoring Opt. # 1|**[Class]** SQL Server Components <br/> **[Class]** SQL Server DB Engine|
|SQL Server DB Monitoring Opt. # 2|**[Group]** SQL Server Components|
|SQL Server AS Monitoring|**[Class]** SSAS Seed <br/> **[Class]** SSAS Instance|
|SQL Server RS Monitoring|**[Class]** SSRS Deployment Seed <br/> **[Class]** Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services Instance Seed <br/> **[Class]** Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services (Native Mode) <br/> **[Class]** SSRS Deployment|

>[!NOTE]
>For the SQL Server DB account, use either **SQL Server DB Monitoring Opt. # 1** or **SQL Server DB Monitoring Opt. # 2**.
