To configure monitoring using the automatic monitoring template, perform the following steps:

1. In the System Center Operations Manager console, navigate to **Authoring | Management Pack Templates**, select and hold **Azure SQL MI - Automatic**, and select **Add Monitoring Wizardâ€¦**.

4. At the **Azure Endpoints** step, select the **Enable checkbox if you want to change default Azure Endpoints** checkbox, and modify the default Azure endpoints, if required. The default endpoints for creating Azure Service Principal Name are as follows:

   - Authority URI: <https://login.windows.net>
   - Management Service URI: <https://management.azure.com>
   - Database Resource URI: `https://database.windows.net`  
   - Graph API Resource URI: <https://graph.windows.net>

5. At the **SPN Configuration** step, select any of the following options:

   - **Auto-Create SPN**

       Select this option if you want your Azure Service Principal Name to be created automatically by the Azure SQL MI MP library using the Azure REST API.
       
       Ensure that the account that you use must have either the **Owner** role (or higher), or any of the following roles:

       - **Active Directory Administrator**
       
       - **Service Administrator** or C**o-Administrator**

       For more information, see [How to - Use the portal to create an Azure AD application and service principal that can access resources](/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal).

   - **Use Existing Run As Profile**

       Select this option if you want to use your own Azure Service Principal Name.

     If you select the **Auto-Create SPN** option, the **Microsoft Azure sign-in** window will be displayed. In this window, enter your work, school, or personal Microsoft account credentials, select **Next**, and complete the form.

    Upon the successful creation of the Azure AD application, at the **Auto-Create SPN Status** step, authentication data will be displayed. Select **Next**.

    If you want to use an existing Run As Profile, at the **SPN Configuration** step, select the **Use Existing Run As Profile** option, select **Next**, and select an existing Run As Account associated with the Azure service principal name. This Run As Account will be used for authentication in Azure Cloud.
