# Create folders from Web console

You can create folders using the web console and save the dashboard inside them.

::: moniker range="sc-om-2019"

In Operations Manager 2016 and later, you can create a folder and place dashboards/views inside it using the Operations console. However, this feature isn't available from the Web console. With 2019 UR2, using the Web console, you can create folders and place dashboards inside them. These folders can be saved in unsealed management packs.

::: moniker range="sc-om-2022"

In Operations Manager, you can create a folder and place dashboards/views inside it using the Operations console and Web console. You can also create folders and place dashboards inside them. These folders can be saved in unsealed management packs.

> [!NOTE]
> Folders and views created from operations console can be viewed in the web console, but the dashboards created from the web console won't be visible in the operations console.


## Create a new folder

Use the following steps:

1. Open the web console and navigate to **Monitoring**.
2. Select **New dashboard**. This opens a right panel like before where **Monitoring** is selected by default.

> - These folders can be deleted from the operations console.


## Save a dashboard inside a folder

1. Open the web console and navigate to **Monitoring**.
2. Select **New dashboard**.
3. Enter the name of the dashboard.
4. Select the folder from the list where you want to store the dashboard.
   Management pack selection will be based on root folder.
6. Select **Save**.
   The dashboard is stored inside the selected folder and can be seen in the left navigation pane.
