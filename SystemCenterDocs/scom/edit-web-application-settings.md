# Edit settings or requests in a Web application

You can use the Web Application Editor to manually create or edit a request in a Web Application Transaction Monitoring template. For editing a particular request, there's no difference whether the request was created manually or by capturing a browser session. For detailed information about the properties that you can set for the request, see Web Application Request Properties.

2. Open the authoring workspace.

3. In the **Authoring** navigation pane, expand **Management Pack Templates**, and select **Web Application Transaction Monitoring**.

4. Select the template that you want to edit, and select **Edit Web Application settings**.

5. Set the properties of the application, and select **Apply**.
