You can save the dashboard in an existing unsealed management pack by selecting the management pack from the **Management Pack** dropdown list or you can save the dashboard by creating a new management pack by selecting **New** next to the **Management Pack** dropdown list and provide a name, description, and optionally a version number.

6. Select **Save** after providing a name and description for the new dashboard.
7. On the blank empty dashboard, you see the dashboard name, **Add Widget**, **Edit Dashboard**, **Delete dashboard**, and **View in fullscreen** options on the top of the page.

    For either option selected, you can search by keyword in the list. As you begin typing, the list filters based on your input.  You can select an individual group or class or multiple from the returned results.

10. Set the criteria to identify the health state to display.  To narrow the results, you can filter by selecting the following:
    * By all health states or a specific state
    * Display all objects or only those in maintenance mode  

    Data matching the defined criteria will only be displayed in the widget.

11. Select **Display** to choose the columns to be displayed in the dashboard.  You can select or search for the columns from the dropdown list.  
12. Complete the configuration by providing a **Name**, **Description**, and **Widget refresh interval** (default interval is 5 minutes) for the widget. Select **Save Widget** to save your new dashboard.  

After the widget has been created, it displays health state of the objects based on the scope and criteria defined. You see the name of the state widget along with the number of objects in the header of the widget. Objects can also be filtered in the widget by searching for a keyword in the filter box.

* Discovered inventory reported for the object instance
* Alerts generated
* Performance metrics
* Classes
* Effective configuration of the rules and monitors running on the target device or system
