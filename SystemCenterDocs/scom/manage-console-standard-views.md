The following table describes the views and folders of the views available when Operations Manager is installed. For views added by a management pack, see the management pack guide for information.

## Next steps

- You can use views and dashboards to visualize operational data from different perspectives to make meaningful decisions.  To understand how to do this, see [Using Views and Dashboards in Operations Manager](manage-console-using-views-dashboards.md).    

- To understand how to create your own custom views and dashboards in Operations Manager, see [Creating Views in Operations Manager](manage-console-scope-views.md). 

- Views included in sealed management packs can be modified to include other monitored object properties.  To customize a view, see [How to Personalize a View in Operations Manager](manage-console-personalize-views.md).
