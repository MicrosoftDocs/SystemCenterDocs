# Standard views in Operations Manager

When you install System Center Operations Manager, it creates several views by default. Management packs also include views. When you import a management pack, the Monitoring workspace creates a folder for the views that the management pack defines.  

The following table describes the views and folders that are available when you install Operations Manager. For views that a management pack adds, see the management pack guide.
