# Managing Virtual Fibre Channel fabrics with VMM
Virtual Fibre Channel enables Hyper\-V virtual machines \(VMs\) on host computers to have direct access to Fibre Channel storage area network \(SAN\) array resources. In this way, you can virtualize applications and workloads that require direct access to SAN logical unit numbers \(LUNs\). Using Virtual Fibre Channel, VM failover clusters can also access Fibre Channel SAN arrays.
