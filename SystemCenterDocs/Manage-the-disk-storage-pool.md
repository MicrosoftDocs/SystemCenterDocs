# Manage the disk storage pool
DPM uses storage pools to store replicas and recovery points for protected data, and transfer logs. DPM requires at least one disk that is dedicated to the storage pool and one that is dedicated to system files, installation files, DPM prerequisite software, and database files. Use the procedures in this section to manage disk settings.
