# Configuring and Using the System Center 2016 - Service Manager Cmdlets for Windows PowerShell
This section provides an introduction to the Service Manager cmdlets for the Windows PowerShell command\-line interface.

Before you can run any command in the Windows PowerShell command\-line interface in Service Manager, you must set execution policy to RemoteSigned. Before you can run data warehouse cmdlets, you must manually import the data warehouse cmdlets module.

The [!INCLUDE[smshort12](../Token/smshort12_md.md)] cmdlets are implemented in the following two modules:

-   **System.Center.Service.Manager**. This module is imported automatically every time a [!INCLUDE[smshort12](../Token/smshort12_md.md)] Windows PowerShell session is opened.

-   **Microsoft.EnterpriseManagement.Warehouse.Cmdlets**. This module must be imported manually.
