# How to Create and Categorize Catalog Items in Localized Languages
In [!INCLUDE[smlong12](Token/smlong12_md.md)], you create and categorize catalog items for localized languages in the same manner that you do for U.S. English. The only difference is that when you create a service offering and a request offering, you do it in the localized language. By doing so, you can create catalog items in the language that is used by the end user who will submit requests. [!INCLUDE[smshort](Token/smshort_md.md)] includes catalog items that have been localized in various languages so that you can copy them and then modify them for use in your organization.

After you have created the service offering and request offerings in a localized language, users need to have the appropriate SharePoint language pack installed on the computers they use to view the [!INCLUDE[smssp](Token/smssp_md.md)]. Additionally, they must select the appropriate language in the [!INCLUDE[smssp](Token/smssp_md.md)] using **Site Settings** in **Site Administration** and then the appropriate selection of the default and alternate language they want to use with **Language Settings**.
