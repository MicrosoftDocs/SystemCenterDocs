# Manage Service Provider Foundation

After you've deployed System Center 2016 - Service Provider Foundation (SPF), there are a number of features to manage:

- [Register SPF in Windows Azure Pack](../manage-register-spf.md): Register SPF to provide services and connectivity for delivering IaaS in Windows Azure Pack.
- [Manage tenants and user roles](../manage-tenants.md): Set up tenants in SPF, and create a tenant self-service user role in VMM.
- [Manage usage metering](../manage-usage-metering.md): Configure SPF to aggregate usage statistics for queries by the SPF Usage web service.
- [Manage gallery resources](../manage-gallery.md): Use SPF to import gallery items into System Center 2016 - Virtual Machine Manager (VMM) from downloaded resource packages
- [Automate and invoke runbooks](../../sma/manage-runbooks.md): Automate and invoke runbooks to provide automated solutions for your tenants.
