# Turn off telemetry settings in Service Provider Foundation

This article provides information about how to turn off the telemetry settings in System Center - Service Provider Foundation (SPF).

By default, SPF sends diagnostic and connectivity data to Microsoft. Microsoft uses this data to provide and improve the quality, security, and integrity of Microsoft products and services.

Administrators can turn off this feature at any point of time.


> [!NOTE]

> Microsoft does not collect any personal data from the customers. We only listen to events that would help diagnostics in SPF. [Learn more](#telemetry-data-collected).


## Turn off telemetry in SPF

Use the following procedure:

1. On the SPF server, Set the value of the "DiagnosticAndUsageDataEnabled" registry subkey under *HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Service Provider Foundation* to 0. If the registry key is not present, then create the key with the name *DiagnosticAndUsageDataEnabled* and set the value to 0.

  - To create a new Registry Key, under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Service Provider Foundation,  right-click, and select **New** > **DWORD (32-bit) Value** as shown below:

    ![spf telemetry new key ](./media/telemetry/spf-telemetry-newkey.png)

  - Enter the name of the key as *DiagnosticAndUsageDataEnabled*.

  - Once the key appears in the list of keys double-click on the key and enter 0 in the *Value data* field as shown below:

2. Use the *Set-SCSpfTelemetry* command and set the telemetry option as shown in the following image:
