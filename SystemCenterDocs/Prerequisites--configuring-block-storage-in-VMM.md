# Prerequisites: configuring block storage in VMM
Before you configure storage in [!INCLUDE[vmm12sp1_long](Token/vmm12sp1_long_md.md)], review the following prerequisites:

-   The storage that you configure in [!INCLUDE[vmm12short](Token/vmm12short_md.md)] must be used by Hyper\-V hosts or host clusters.

-   Storage arrays must be on the list in [Supported storage arrays for System Center 2012 VMM](http://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/16100.supported-storage-arrays-for-system-center-2012-vmm.aspx). Note that [!INCLUDE[vmm12short](Token/vmm12short_md.md)] recognizes storage on storage arrays that do not appear in this list. However, there is no guarantee that you can perform active management operations, such a logical unit provisioning, masking and unmasking, cloning, and taking snapshots on those storage arrays through [!INCLUDE[vmm12short](Token/vmm12short_md.md)]. If a storage array is not on this list, we recommend that you contact your storage vendor to determine [!INCLUDE[vmm12short](Token/vmm12short_md.md)] support.

-   WMI SMP providers from Dell EqualLogic and Nexsan must be installed on the [!INCLUDE[vmm12short](Token/vmm12short_md.md)] management server.

-   The SMI\-S provider cannot be installed on the [!INCLUDE[vmm12short](Token/vmm12short_md.md)] management server.

-   If the SMI\-S provider type for the storage array is a "proxy" provider that must be installed on a separate server, obtain and install the latest version of the SMI\-S provider from your storage vendor on a server that the [!INCLUDE[vmm12short](Token/vmm12short_md.md)] management server can access over the network by IP address or by the fully qualified domain name \(FQDN\).

-   Review the choice between configuring one storage group per cluster or one storage group per node.

    > [!NOTE]
    > In [!INCLUDE[vmm12short](Token/vmm12short_md.md)], a "storage group" binds together host initiators, target ports, and logical units. A storage group contains the hostâ€™s initiator IDs \(one or more\), in the form of either iSCSI Qualified Name \(IQN\) or World Wide Name \(WWN\). A storage group also contains one or more target ports and one or more logical units. Logical units are exposed to the host initiators through the target ports.

    When [!INCLUDE[vmm12short](Token/vmm12short_md.md)] manages the assignment of logical units, by default, it creates one storage group or masking set per host. The host can be either a stand\-alone host or a host cluster node. However, for some storage arrays, it is preferable to use one storage group for the entire cluster, where host initiators for all cluster nodes are contained in a single storage group. To support this configuration, you must set the `CreateStorageGroupsPerCluster` property to `$true` by using the   [Set-SCStorageArray](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj613218.aspx) cmdlet.
