# Getting Started with System Center Technical Preview - Operations Manager
Welcome to the Getting Started documentation for Operations Manager, a component of [!INCLUDE[sc_threshold_1](./Token/sc_threshold_1_md.md)].

Operations Manager enables you to monitor services, devices, and operations for many computers in a single console. Operators can gain rapid insight into the state of the IT environment and the IT services running across different systems and workloads by using numerous views that show state, health, and performance information, as well as alerts generated for availability, performance, configuration, and security situations.
