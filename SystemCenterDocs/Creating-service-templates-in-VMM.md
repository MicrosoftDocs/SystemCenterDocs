# Creating service templates in VMM
In [!INCLUDE[vmm12sp1_long](Token/vmm12sp1_long_md.md)], a service is a set of virtual machines that are configured and deployed together and are managed as a single entityâ€”for example, a deployment of a multi\-tier line\-of\-business application.

A service template defines the configuration of a service. In [!INCLUDE[vmm12short](Token/vmm12short_md.md)], you use the Service Template Designer to create a service template. The service template includes information about the virtual machines that are deployed as part of the service, which applications to install on the virtual machines, and the networking configuration needed for the service \(including the use of a load balancer\).

Before creating a service template, review the information in [Preparing to create services in VMM](Preparing-to-create-services-in-VMM.md).
