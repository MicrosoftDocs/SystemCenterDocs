# Management Server Disaster Recovery in Service Manager
This section describes how to recover a [!INCLUDE[smlong12](./Token/smlong12_md.md)] management server or a data warehouse management server. If you installed additional [!INCLUDE[smshort](./Token/smshort_md.md)] management servers, you have the option of promoting an additional [!INCLUDE[smshort](./Token/smshort_md.md)] management server. Regardless of whether you encounter software or hardware failures of the [!INCLUDE[smshort](./Token/smshort_md.md)] management server, your recovery process is based on restoring a computer that has the same computer name.

For either management server, your first step must be to restore the encryption key *before* you start the management server setup.
