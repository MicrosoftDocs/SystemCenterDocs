# How to Use the Integration Toolkit to Extend Orchestrator Capabilities

> Applies To: System Center 2016 - Orchestrator

System Center 2016 - Orchestrator provides two options for extending standard activities. You can either build new activities,or create new Integration Packs (IP). IPs are collections of activities for Microsoft and products of other companies  which are specific to a product or technology. If the functionality that you require is not available in an IP, you have the alternative option of using the Orchestrator Integration Toolkit. 

The System Center 2016 Orchestrator Integration Toolkit is a set of tools to help you create new integrations for Orchestrator. You can use wizards in the Integration Toolkit to easily create new workflow activities and Integration Packs that extend the capabilities of the product. You can also create custom workflow activities using the Orchestrator SDK and C\#, and then package them into an IP using this toolkit.
