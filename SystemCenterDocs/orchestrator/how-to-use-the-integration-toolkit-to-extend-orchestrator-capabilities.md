# How to Use the Integration Toolkit to Extend Orchestrator Capabilities

> Applies To: System Center 2016 - Orchestrator

The System Center 2016 Orchestrator Integration Toolkit is a set of tools to help you create new integrations for Orchestrator. Using wizard\-based applications, you can easily create new workflow activities and Integration Packs that extend the capabilities of the product. You can also create custom workflow activities using the Orchestrator SDK and C\#, and then package them into an Integration Pack using this toolkit. For complete documentation for the Orchestrator Integration Toolkit, see the [MSDN Library](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=261687).
