## Register and deploy the integration pack

After you download the integration pack file, you must register it with the Orchestrator management server, and then deploy it to runbook servers and Runbook Designer. For specific procedures, see [How To install an integration pack](how-to-add-an-integration-pack.md).

## Configure the Configuration Manager integration pack connection settings

Connections provide a way for you to define the way that the Configuration Manager Activities will connect to the Configuration Manager server(s) in your infrastructure. You must define at least one connection in order to use the Configuration Manager activities, but you can define as many as you need in order to connect to different Configuration Manager servers or utilize different connection settings or credentials.

### Set up a Configuration Manager connection

To set up a Configuration Manager connection, follow these steps:

1. In the Runbook Designer, select **Options**, and select **Configuration Manager**. The **Configuration Manager** dialog appears.

2. On the **Connections** tab, select **Add** to begin the connection setup. The **Add Connection** dialog appears.

3. In the **Name** box, enter a name for the connection. This could be the name of the *Active Directory* domain, or a descriptive name to distinguish the type of connection.

4. In the Server box, enter the name or IP address of the Configuration Manager computer. If you're using the computer name, you can enter the NetBIOS name or the Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN). If you've installed Orchestrator on the Configuration Manager server, you can enter “Localhost” or the NetBIOS name of the server.

5. In the **Username** and **Password** boxes, enter the credentials that Orchestrator will use to connect to the Configuration Manager Site Server. 

> [!NOTE]
> The Username includes the domain name, for example: “contoso\admin”.

6. Select **Test Connection**. When the message "Successfully connected" appears, select **OK**.

7. Select **OK** to close the configuration dialog, and select **Finish**.
