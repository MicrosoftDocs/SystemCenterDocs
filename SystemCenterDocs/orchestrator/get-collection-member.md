# Get Collection Member activity for Configuration Manager Integration Pack

::: moniker-end

The Get Collection Member activity is used in a runbook that queries an
existing Configuration Manager collection for its member computers. This
lets you specify computers individually to obtain status or perform
other activities.

This activity returns the properties associated with the
SMS\_FullCollectionMembership WMI class scoped to the collection
specified.

## Get Collection Member properties

- Collection Name: The display name or ID of an existing collection
    >[!NOTE]
    >When you use the browse feature to look up a collection name, or enter a collection name manually or from published data, you must set the **Collection Value Type** property to **Name** or the activity will fail.
- Collection Value Type: Specifies whether the value in the **Collection** property is a name or a collection ID. Options are:
    - **ID** (default): the value is a collection ID
    - **Name**: the value is a collection name
