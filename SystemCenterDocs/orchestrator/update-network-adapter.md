The Update Network Adapter activity is used to make changes to an existing network adapter.

The activity publishes all the data from the required and optional properties into published data. The following tables list the required and optional properties and published data for this activity.

## Update Network Adapter Required Properties

| Element   | Description   |
|:---|:---|
| Virtual Network Adapter ID | The unique identifier (GUID) for the Virtual Network Adapter. |   

## Update Network Adapter Optional Properties

| Element   | Description   |
|:---|:---|
| Logical Network   | The name or IP subnet for the logical network.      |
| MAC Address   | Dynamic or Static. You can specify a Static MAC address or choose &lt;Static-Auto&gt;, in which case the static address will be generated by the activity.      |
| MAC Address pool   | When the MAC address is set to **Static**, you must specify the MAC address pool.      |
| Network Location   | The network location for a physical network adapter or for a virtual network adapter      |
| Network Tag   | An alphanumeric value of your choice to differentiate the host's virtual networks, based on a criterion such as throughput or security. Network tags can be used to match virtual machines with suitable hosts.    |
| Virtual Network ID | The unique identifier (GUID) of the Virtual Network specified at the host level of the Virtual Machine Manager configuration      |
| VLAN ID   | A numeric identifier in the range 1 through 4094 for the Network VLAN      |


## Update Network Adapter Published Data

| Element   | Description   |
|:---|:---|
| Accessibility   | Public or Internal      |
| Added Time   | The date and time that the Virtual Network Adapter was added, in the format yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss AM or PM      |
| Enabled   | True or False. If False, the virtual machine can't be started.      |
| Ethernet Address   | The Virtual Network Adapter address, in the format 00:00:00:00:00:00      |
| Ethernet Address Type   | Dynamic or Static      |
| MAC Address   | Dynamic or Static      |
| MAC Addresses Spoofing Enabled | True or False. If True, allows the guest operating system of a Hyper-V virtual machine to provide an alternative MAC Address to the one that the virtual machine provides.      |
| Modified Time   | The date and time that the Virtual Network Adapter was modified, in the format yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss AM or PM      |
| Network Location   | The network location for a physical network adapter or for a virtual network adapter      |
| Network Tag   | An alphanumeric value to differentiate the host's virtual networks, based on a criterion such as throughput or security. Network tags can be used to match virtual machines with suitable hosts.    |
| Physical Address   | The Virtual Network Adapter physical address, in the format 00:00:00:00:00:00      |
| Physical Address Type   | Dynamic or Static      |
| Synthetic   | True or False      |
| Virtual Network Adapter ID   | The unique identifier (GUID) of the Virtual Network Adapter      |
| Virtual Network Adapter Name   | The name of the Network Adapter, which is auto-generated      |
| Virtual Network Adapter Type   | Emulated or Synthetic      |
| Virtual Network ID   | The unique identifier (GUID) of the Virtual Network specified at the host level of the Virtual Machine Manager configuration      |
| Virtual Network Name   | The name of the Virtual Network specified at the host level of the Virtual Machine Manager configuration      |
| VLAN Enabled   | True or False      |
| VLAN ID   | A numeric identifier in the range 1 through 4094 for the Network VLAN      |
| VM ID   | The unique identifier (GUID) of the virtual machine for which the network adapter was created      |
| VMW Adapter Index   | The index number of the Virtual Network Adapter      |
