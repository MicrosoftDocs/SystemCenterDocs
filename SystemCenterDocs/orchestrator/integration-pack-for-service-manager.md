## Register and deploy the pPack

After you download the integration pack file, you must register it with the Orchestrator management server and then deploy it to Runbook servers and Runbook Designers. [Learn more](how-to-add-an-integration-pack.md) about installing an integration pack.

## Configure the connections

A connection establishes a reusable link between Orchestrator and a Service Manager Server. You can create as many connections as you need to specify links to multiple servers. You can also create multiple connections to the same server to allow for differences in security permissions for different user accounts.


1.  In the Runbook Designer, click the **Options** menu, and select Service Manager.
2.  On the **Connections** tab, click **Add** to begin the connection setup.
3.  In the **Name** box, enter a name for the connection. This could be the name of the Service Manager server, or a descriptive name to distinguish the type of connection.
4.  In the **Server** box, click the ellipsis button **(...)**. Select the Service Manager server, and then click **OK**.
5.  In the **Credentials** section, type the **Domain**, **User name**, and **Password** that the Orchestrator server will use to connect to the Service Manager computer.
6.  In the **Monitoring Intervals** section, enter the **Polling** and **Reconnect** intervals that the Orchestrator server will use with the connection to the Server Manager computer. The default is **10 seconds**.
7.  Click **Test Connection**. When the success message appears, click **OK**.
8.  Add additional connections if applicable. Click **OK** to close the configuration dialog box, and then click **Finish**.
