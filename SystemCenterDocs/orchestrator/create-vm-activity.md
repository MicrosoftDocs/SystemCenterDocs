# Create VM Activity

::: moniker range=">= sc-orch-1801 <= sc-orch-1807"

[!INCLUDE [eos-notes-orchestrator.md](../includes/eos-notes-orchestrator.md)]

::: moniker-end

The Create VM activity is added to a runbook to create a new virtual machine. The runbook can be used to create virtual machines on demand based on self-service provisioning processes.

The following tables list the required and optional properties and published data for this activity.

The activity publishes all of the data from the required and optional properties into published data. Additional published data is generated based on the class that you select when you define the activity.

## Create VM Activity Required Properties

## Configuring the Create VM Activity

The following procedure describes the steps required to configure a Create VM activity.

#### To configure the Create VM Activity

1.  From the **Activities** pane, drag a **Create VM** activity to the active runbook.

2.  Double-click the **Create VM** activity icon. The **Properties** dialog box opens.

3.  Configure the settings in the **Properties** tab as follows:

    1.  In the **Configuration** section, click the ellipsis button **(...)**, and then select the VMware vSphere server connection that you want to use for this activity. Click **OK**.
    2.  In the **Properties** section, enter a value for each of the required properties and the applicable optional properties. If the property is Lookup-enabled, you can click the ellipsis **(...)** button next to the text box to browse for a value.
        You can also use published data to automatically populate the value of the property from the data output by a previous activity in the workflow.

4.  Click **Finish**.
