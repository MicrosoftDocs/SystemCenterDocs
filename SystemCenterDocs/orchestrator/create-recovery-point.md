# Create Recovery Point

The Create Recovery Point activity is used to create a backup for a selected data source. This activity allows you to create a recovery point outside the Data Protection Manager scheduled interval as configured for a protection group. This activity can also be used to force creation of an initial replica. For more information, see Protect Data Source.

The behavior is synchronous - the activity will run for as long it takes for Data Protection Manager to complete the action.

The activity publishes all of the data from the required and optional properties into published data. The following tables list the required and optional properties and published data for this activity.

## Create Recovery Point Required Properties

| Element   | Sample Value   |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| DataSourceID | The unique identifier (GUID) of the data source for the recovery point. This ID can be obtained using the Get Data Source activity prior to this activity in the runbook and subscribing to the DataSourceId property in published data. |
