# Create Alert

::: moniker range=">= sc-orch-1801 <= sc-orch-1807"

[!INCLUDE [eos-notes-orchestrator.md](../includes/eos-notes-orchestrator.md)]

::: moniker-end

The Create Alert activity is used in a runbook to create a new alert in an Operations Manager management group.

The first time you run this activity in a runbook, it installs the Orchestrator Integration Library Management Pack in Operations Manager. The Create Alert activity creates an event in Operations Manager, which the Orchestrator Integration Library Management Pack then translates into a System Center Operations Manager alert.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>When the Create Alert activity runs for the first time, it does not create an alert. The workaround is to run it again. The new alert is created after the activity is run a second time.

The activity publishes all of the data from the required and optional properties into published data. The following tables list the required and optional properties and published data for this activity.
