The Monitor Message activity invokes a runbook when certain HP Operations Manager messages are created, updated, acknowledged, or unacknowledged according to filter criteria that you specify. The activity uses filters to determine which messages should invoke the runbook.

The following tables list the required properties and published data for this activity. For more information on configuring activities, see [HP Operations Manager Activities](operations-manager-activities.md).

## Monitor Message required properties

| Element   | Description   | Value Type   |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Monitor New Messages   | The runbook will be invoked if the monitor detects a new message.   | True<br>False |
| Monitor Modified Messages   | The runbook will be invoked if the monitor detects a modified message.   | True<br>False |
| Monitor Acknowledged Messages   | The runbook will be invoked if the monitor detects a message that was acknowledged   | True<br>False |
| Monitor UnAcknowledged Messages | The runbook will be invoked if the monitor detects a message that was unacknowledged | True<br>False |
