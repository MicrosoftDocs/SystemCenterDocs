System Center - Orchestrator includes a set of standard activities that are automatically installed. You can expand functionality and ability of Orchestrator to integrate platforms and products by Microsoft and other companies by installing integration packs. Each integration pack contains activities that provide functions that are unique to that product. Microsoft provides integration packs for all the System Center components, several other Microsoft products, and products from other companies.

Integration packs are available from the Microsoft Download Center. Each integration pack has a guide that provides installation instructions, known issues, and reference information for the activities in that integration pack.

> [!NOTE]
> Orchestrator doesn't support a downgrade of integration packs. If you have an integration pack that's currently registered or previously registered in Orchestrator, installation fails if you attempt to install an earlier version of the same integration pack. You should test integration packs and upgraded integration packs in a test environment before you implement them in a production environment. If you require a downgrade of an integration pack in a production environment, contact Microsoft Customer Support for assistance.

## Register and deploy an integration pack

After you download the integration pack, you register the integration pack file with the Orchestrator management server, and then deploy it to Runbook Servers and computers that have the Runbook Designer installed. For more information about how to install a specific integration pack, see the guide for that integration pack.

When you install an upgrade of an integration pack, you must first uninstall any earlier version of the integration pack from all the Runbook Servers and Runbook Designers. You then register and deploy the upgrade of the integration pack. If you don't uninstall the previous version of the integration pack prior to registering and deploying the upgrade version, the upgrade version will fail.

5.	In the Installation Options dialog, configure the following settings.
6.	To choose a time to deploy the integration pack, select the Schedule installation checkbox, and then select the time and date from the Perform installation list.
7.	Select one of the following:
    * Stop all running runbooks before installing the integration pack to stop all running runbooks before deploying the integration pack.
