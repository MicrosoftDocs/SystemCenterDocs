# Get Deployment Status activity for Configuration Manager Integration Pack

The Get Deployment Status activity is used to retrieve the status of an
application, program, task sequence, or software update deployment
assigned to a computer or collection to determine if a software
deployment action has completed.

To deploy an application (using the new Configuration Manager
application model), use the **Deploy Application** activity. To deploy a
task sequence, use the **Deploy Task Sequence** activity. To deploy
software updates in an update group, use the **Deploy Software Update**
activity. To deploy a legacy application, use the **Deploy Program**
activity.

## Get Deployment Status properties

- Deployment Type: The type of deployment for which you want to retrieve information. Options are:
    - Application
    - Program
    - Task Sequence
    - Software Update
- Filters: Filters available are dependent on the type of deployment selected. Filters modify the query sent to Configuration Manager so that the data returned to Orchestrator is already limited to desired results. This improves performance over returning all data and filtering at the Orchestrator server.

To add new filter criteria:

1. Select **Add** and select the property on which to filter.
2. Select a **Relation** and then enter a value for the filter.

   The type of relation value available will depend on the data type of the property selected.

## Get Deployment Status published data

The following values are published in addition to the input values
above:

|Element|Description|
|---|---|
|Connection|Specifies the name of the connection to the Configuration Manager server. |
|Result Count|The number of values returned by the query. |

The following list describes the Published Data for the available
Deployment Types.
