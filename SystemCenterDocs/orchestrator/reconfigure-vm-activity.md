# Reconfigure VM activity

The Reconfigure VM activity is used in a runbook to change the hardware settings of a virtual machine. This allows the runbook to increase the number of CPUs and Memory to increase the availability of the application running in the guest operating system.

The following tables list the required and optional properties and published data for this activity.

The activity publishes all the data from the required and optional properties into published data. Additional published data is generated based on the class that you select when you define the activity.

## Configure the Reconfigure VM activity

To configure the Reconfigure VM activity, follow these steps:

1.  From the **Activities** pane, drag a **Reconfigure VM** activity to the active runbook.

2.  Double-click the **Reconfigure VM** activity icon. The **Properties** dialog opens.

3.  Configure the settings in the **Properties** tab as follows:

    1.  In the **Configuration** section, select the ellipsis button **(...)**, and then select the VMware vSphere server connection that you want to use for this activity. Select **OK**.
    2.  In the **Properties** section, enter a value for each of the required properties and the applicable optional properties. If the property is Lookup-enabled, you can select the ellipsis **(...)** button next to the text box to browse for a value.
        You can also use published data to automatically populate the value of the property from the data output by a previous activity in the workflow.

4.  Select **Finish**.
