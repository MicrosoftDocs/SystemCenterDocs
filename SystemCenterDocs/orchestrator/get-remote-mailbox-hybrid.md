| Active Directory User Name   | Specifies the user name that you will use to access the on-premises Active Directory.   | String   |
| ANR   | Specifies a string on which to perform an ambiguous name resolution (ANR) search. You can specify a partial string and search for objects with an attribute that matches that string.

| Ignore Default Scope   | Instructs the command to ignore the default recipient scope setting for the Exchange Management Shell session and to use the entire forest as the scope. This allows the command to access the Active Directory objects that are not currently in the default scope.

The command uses an appropriate global catalog server automatically.<br>You can only use the DN for the Identity property. Other forms of identification, such as alias, are not accepted.<br>You cannot use the On Premises Organizational Unit and Identity properties together.<br>You cannot use the User Name and Password properties. | True, False   |
| On-Premises Organizational Unit | Specifies a container in the on-premises organization in which to limit the results. You can specify either an organizational unit (OU) or a domain.

| Read From Domain Controller   | Specifies that the user information is read from a domain controller in the user's domain. If you set the recipient scope to include all recipients in the forest and do not use this property, it is possible that the user information is read from a global catalog with outdated information. If you use this property, multiple reads might be necessary in order to get the information.<br>By default, the recipient scope is set to the domain that hosts your servers that run Exchange.   | True, False   |
| Result Size   | Specifies the maximum number of results to return. If you want to return all mailboxes that match the query, use **unlimited** for the value of this property. The default value is **unlimited**.   | String   |
| Sort By   | Specifies the attribute by which to sort the results. You can sort by only one attribute at a time. You can sort by the following attributes: <br>Alias<br>Display name<br>Name<br> **Note** The results are sorted in ascending order.   | String   |
