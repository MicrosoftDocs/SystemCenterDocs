## Registering and Deploying the Integration Pack

After you download the integration pack file, you must register it with the Orchestrator management server, and then deploy it to Runbook servers and Runbook Designers. For the procedures on installing integration packs, see [How To Install an Integration Pack](how-to-add-an-integration-pack.md).

## Default Credentials

Default credentials are used to store a common set of credentials that can be selected when configuring an HP iLO and OA connection.

### To set up default credentials

1.  In the Runbook Designer, select the **Options** menu, and select HP iLO and OA. The HP iLO and OA dialog appears.
2.  On the **Connections** tab, select **Default credentials** to begin the setup. The **Default credentials** dialog appears.
3.  In the **User name** box, enter a default user name.
4.  In the **Password** box, enter a default password.
5.  In the **Key** box, enter a default key or select the ellipsis (...) button to browse and select a Key.
6.  Select **OK** to close the default credentials dialog.

## Configuring the HP iLO and OA Connections

A connection establishes a reusable link between Orchestrator and an HP iLO and OA system. You can create as many connections as you require to specify links to multiple systems running HP iLO and OA. You can also create multiple connections to the same system to allow for differences in security permissions for different user accounts.

### To set up an HP iLO and OA connection

1.  In the Runbook Designer, select **Options**, and select **HP iLO and OA**. The HP iLO and OA dialog appears.
2.  On the **Connections** tab, select **Add** to begin the connection setup. The **Connection** dialog appears.
3.  In the **Name** box, enter a name for the connection. This could be the name of the HP iLO and OA system or a descriptive name to distinguish the type of connection.
4.  In the **Address** box, enter the name or IP address of the HP iLO and OA system. If you're using the computer name, you can enter the NetBIOS name or the fully qualified domain name (FQDN).
5.  In the **Port** box, enter the number of the HP iLO and OA system.
6.  Select **Use default credentials** to apply the default credentials to this connection. If you do this, then you can skip the next two steps.
7.  In the **Username** and **Password** boxes, enter the credentials that Orchestrator will use to connect to the HP iLO and OA system.
8.  In the **Private Key** box, optionally specify the SSH key used to connect to the HP iLO and OA system.
9.  In the **Attempts** box, enter the number or times a command will attempt before failing.
10. In the **Time between attempts** box, enter the number in seconds between each attempt.
11. Select **OK** to close the configuration dialog.
12. Select the connection and select the **Test** button. **Test connection succeeded** will appear when the connection is valid. Select **Finish**.
