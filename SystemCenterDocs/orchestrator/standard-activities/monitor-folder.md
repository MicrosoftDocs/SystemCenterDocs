The Monitor Folder activity invokes a runbook when the folder that you specified has changed, or if the files within that folder have been changed. You can monitor the size of log files in a folder. If the files grow too large, the Monitor Folder activity can invoke a runbook that will archive, backup, and then purge the log files to clean up the folder.  

## Configuring the Monitor Folder Activity  
 Before you configure the Monitor Folder activity, you need to determine the following:  

- The folder name you're monitoring.  

- What condition invokes the runbooks.  

- Optionally, you may need to know what file types you want to monitor.  

Use the following information to configure the Monitor Folder activity.
