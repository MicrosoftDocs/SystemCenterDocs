# Monitor Counter

The Monitor Counter activity invokes a runbook when a counter has reached a value that you specify. Each Monitor Counter activity monitors one counter.  

 Use the Monitor Counter activity to monitor a counter that counts the number of times that a runbook has attempted to start a service. When that number reaches the number that you configure in the Monitor Counter activity, the Monitor Counter activity can invoke a [Send Email](send-email.md) activity to notify an administrator to investigate the problem.  

## Configure the Monitor Counter Activity

 Before you configure the Monitor Counter activity, you need to determine the following:  

- The **Counter** you'll be monitoring.  

  > [!WARNING]
  > Before you can use this activity, you must configure a **Counter**.  

- The value that will invoke the runbook.

Use the following information to configure the Monitor Counter activity.
