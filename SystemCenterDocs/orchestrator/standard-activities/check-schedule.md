# Check Schedule

The Check schedule activity verifies that a runbook is allowed to run at the current time according to the permitted times or interval configured in a schedule. To use this activity, you can create a schedule and configure the permitted times, denied times, or interval at which the runbook can run. Then you can insert the activity into a runbook following a [Monitor Date/Time](monitor-date-time.md) activity and configure it to check the schedule to verify whether a runbook is allowed to run at the current time. You can also use the Check Schedule activity in a runbook that monitors systems for availability. If a problem is encountered, the Check Schedule activity can verify whether the current time is during business hours or in or out of a maintenance window.  

## Configure the Check Schedule Activity

To configure the Check Schedule activity, follow these steps:

1. From the **Activity pane**, drag a **Check Schedule** activity to the runbook.  

2. Double-click the **Check Schedule** activity icon to open the **Properties** dialog.  

3. Select the **Details** tab, and next to the **Schedule Template** box, select the ellipsis **(...)** button and in the **Select a Schedule** dialog, select the **Schedule** that you want to verify.
