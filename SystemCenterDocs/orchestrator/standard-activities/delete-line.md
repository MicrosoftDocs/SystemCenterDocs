# Delete Line

The Delete Line activity deletes lines from a text file. Use the Delete Line activity to delete outdated lines of text from a text file.  

 This activity replaces functionality in the Manage Text File legacy activity from Opalis 6.3.  

## Configure the Delete Line Activity

 Before you configure the Delete Line activity, you need to determine the following:  

- The name of the file that you want to delete the line from.  

- The file encoding type that the file you want to delete the line from uses.  

- The line numbers of the lines that you want to delete.  

Use the following information to configure the Delete Line activity.  

### Details Tab  

|Settings|Configuration Instructions|  
|--------------|--------------------------------|  
|**File**|Enter the path and name of the file that you want to delete the text from, or select the ellipsis button (...) and browse for it.|  
|**File encoding**|Select the ellipsis button **(...)** and select the format that the file is encoded in from the File encoding drop-down list. Verify that you select the correct encoding format. If the file uses a different encoding format, the activity fails.|  
|**Line numbers**|Enter the line numbers of the text that you want to delete from the file that you specified.<br /><br /> To specify a range of lines, use a hyphen: 1-3. This deletes lines 1 to 3.<br /><br /> To specify specific lines, use a comma: 5,7,9. This deletes lines 5, 7, and 9.<br /><br /> Combine the range and specific lines: 1-3,5,7,9. This deletes lines 1 to 3, and lines 5, 7, and 9.<br /><br /> To specify from a specific line to the last line of the file, type the line number, hyphen, and END: 4-END. This deletes lines 4 to the last line of the file.<br /><br /> To specify from a specific line to a line relative to the last line of the file, type the line number, hyphen, the less-than sign, and the line number relative to the end line: 4-END<3. If the file has 20 lines, this deletes lines 4 to 17 from the file. <3 represents the third line from the end.<br /><br /> To specify the last number of lines, type LASTLINES, colon, and the last number of lines that you want to delete: LASTLINES: 10. This deletes the last 10 lines of the file.<br /><br /> Combine different types of operations: 1-5, 8, 10-END<20, LASTLINES: 10. This deletes lines 1 to 5, line 8, line 10 to the 20th line from the end, and the last 10 lines. Don't overlap lines or line ranges when combining operations. For example, 5-END, LASTLINES:10 fails because the 5-END operation already deletes to the end, so the LASTLINES:10 operation can't succeed because the lines are already deleted, and the activity fails. **Important:** Don't specify line numbers that don't exist in the file, and don't specify a line number more than once, or the activity fails.|
