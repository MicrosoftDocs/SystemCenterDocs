# Set SNMP Variable
The Set SNMP Variable activity will modify a variable, specified by its MIB, on a network device. Use the Set SNMP Variable to update a variable that reports on the failure or success of a critical runbook.  
  
## Configuring the Set SNMP Variable Activity  
 Before you configure the Set SNMP Variable activity you need to determine the following:  
  
-   IP address of the device as well as the port number, SNMP MIB, and the SNMP version  
  
-   Community string required to update the variable  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  You cannot set individual security credentials for this activity. It will run under the service account configured for the Runbook Service on the Runbook server where the instance of the activity is running. This account must have the authority to access the resources and perform the actions required by this activity.  
  
 Use the following information to configure the Set SNMP Variable activity.  
  
### Details Tab  
  
|Settings|Configuration Instructions|  
|--------------|--------------------------------|  
|**IP address**|Type the IP address of the device hosting the MIB variable.|  
|**Port**|Type port used to communicate with the network device.|  
|**Object identifier**|Type the MIB identifier of the variable whose value you want to change.|  
|**Object value**|Type the new value of the variable you are changing. Make sure that the new value matches the constraints that are set out by device manufacturer. This field is case-sensitive and supports only alphanumeric characters.|  
|**SNMP version**|Select the SNMP version to use when connecting to the network device. You can select **SNMPv1** or **SNMPv2c**.|  
|**Community string**|Type the community string that will be used to authenticate against the network device. The community should have rights of Read write or higher. This field is case-sensitive and supports only alphanumeric characters.|  
  
### Advanced Tab
