The Modify Counter increments and decrements a counter, as well as resets it to its default value. It also sets it to a value you specify. Wherever you need to update the value of a counter, use the Modify Counter activity to update its value.  

 The current value of a counter is specific for every runbook that uses that counter. The first time a counter is used, the default value that has been specified in the counters configuration will be used. You can only modify the value of counters in a runbook using the Modify Counter activity.  

## Configuring the Modify Counter Activity  
 Before you configure the Modify Counter activity, you need to determine the following:  

- The counter you are updating.  

- The type of update that will be made.  

Use the following information to configure the Modify Counter activity.
