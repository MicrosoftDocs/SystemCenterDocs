### Publishing web services  
 The Invoke Web Service object builds an assembly at **C:\ProgramData\Microsoft System Center 2012\Orchestrator\Activities\WebServices2**or **C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\Microsoft System Center 2012\Orchestrator\Activities\WebServices2**. The assembly is identified by the web service location. For example, **http://localhost/TestService/DylanService.asmx?WSDL**.  

 If you publish additional services or update an existing service, you must clean the cache, except for the **wspkey.snk** file. After cleaning the cache, the web service changes are   correctly published.
