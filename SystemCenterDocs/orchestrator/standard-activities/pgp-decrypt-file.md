# PGP Decrypt File

The PGP Decrypt File activity decrypts a file or entire folder tree using a PGP key file and passphrase that you've created. When decrypting an entire folder, the folder tree is preserved from the root folder down. For example, if you decrypt C:\Documents and Settings\Administrator\My Documents\\\*.\* and all subfolders, all files in My Documents are decrypted and also all the files in the folders under My Documents. All the files in subfolders will be in the same subfolder in the Output folder.  

You can use the PGP Decrypt File activity to decrypt files that were encrypted as part of a backup operation. To use this activity, you must install the gpg executable.

## Install GnuPG

GnuPG is an open-source program used by the standard activities PGP Encrypt file and PGP Decrypt file to encrypt and decrypt files. The following procedures describe how to install this executable program and associated file on a runbook server or computer that is running the Runbook Designer.

### Install GnuPG version 1.x and 2.0.x

Use the following steps:

1. Download gpg.exe and iconv.dll, version 1.4.10 or later, from [GnuPG](https://www.gnupg.org/).
2. Save gpg.exe and iconv.dll to the \<System drive\>:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Microsoft System Center \<version\>\Orchestrator\Extensions\Support\Encryption folder on each runbook server and computer that's running the Runbook Designer.

### Install GnuPG version 2.x

Use the following steps:

1. Download gpg.exe, gpg-agent.exe, iconv.dll, libassuan-0.dll, libgcrypt-20.dll, libgpg-error-0.dll, libnpth-0.dll, libsqlite3-0.dll, and zlib1.dll version 2.x or later from [GnuPG](https://www.gnupg.org/).

2. Save gpg.exe, gpg-agent.exe, iconv.dll, libassuan-0.dll, libgcrypt-20.dll, libgpg-error-0.dll, libnpth-0.dll, libsqlite3-0.dll, and zlib1.dll to the \<System drive\>:\Program Files(x86)\Common Files\<Microsoft System Center Orchestrator \<version\>\Orchestrator\Extensions\Support\Encryption folder on each runbook server and computer that is running the Runbook Designer.

## Configure the PGP Decrypt Activity

 Use the following information to configure the PGP Decrypt File activity.  

### Details Tab  

|Settings|Configuration Instructions|  
|--------------|--------------------------------|  
|**Path**|Enter the path of the files that you want to decrypt. You can use wildcards, **?** and * to specify the files that you're decrypting. This field will only accept characters from the current system locale. If you use other characters, the activity will fail.|
