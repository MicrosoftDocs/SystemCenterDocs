The Find Text activity finds lines in a text file. Use the Find Text activity to find according to a search string that you specify.  

 This activity replaces functionality in the Manage Text File legacy activity from Opalis 6.3.  

## Configuring the Find Text Activity  
 Before you configure the Find Text activity, you need to determine the following:  

- The name of the file that you want to search in.  

- The encoding type of the file you want to search in uses.  

- The text that you want to search for.  

Use the following information to configure the Find Text activity.  

### Details Tab  

|Settings|Configuration Instructions|

|**File**|Type the path and name of the file that you want to find the text in, or select the ellipsis button **(...)** and browse for it.|  
|**File encoding**|Select the ellipsis button **(...)** and select the format that the file is encoded in from the File encoding drop-down list. Verify that you select the correct encoding format: if the file uses a different encoding format, the activity fails.|
