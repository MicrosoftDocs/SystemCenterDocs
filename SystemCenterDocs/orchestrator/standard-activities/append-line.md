# Append Line

The Append Line activity appends a line of text into a text file. Use the Append Line activity to append lines to a log file to create audits trails of runbooks.  

 This activity replaces functionality in the Manage Text File legacy activity from Opalis 6.3.  

## Configure the Append Line Activity

 Before you configure the Append Line activity, you need to determine the following:  

- The file name you want to append to.  

- The type of file encoding that the file you're appending to uses.  

- The text you append.  

Use the following information to configure the Append Line activity.
