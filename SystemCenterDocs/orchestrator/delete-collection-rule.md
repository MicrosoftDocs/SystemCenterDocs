# Delete collection rule activity

The Delete Collection Rule activity is used to redefine the membership
of a collection by removing collection membership rules from the
collection. Membership rules determine the resources that are included
in the collection when it updates.

To use this activity, a collection must already exist, which can be
created by the **Create Collection** activity. Membership rules can be
added to the collection by using the **Add Collection Rule** activity.
To force re-evaluation of the collection’s membership after adding or
removing collection rules, use the **Update Collection Membership**
activity.
