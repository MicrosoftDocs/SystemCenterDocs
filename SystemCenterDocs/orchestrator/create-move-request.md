You can use the Create Move Request activity to create a new mailbox move request and to begin the process of an asynchronous mailbox or personal archive move for an on-premises environment.

The following tables list the required properties, optional properties, and published data for this activity.

## Required properties for the Create Move Request activity

| **Element** | **Description**   | **Valid values** |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Identity   | Specifies the identity of the mailbox or mail user. This can be one of the following value types:<br>Globally unique identifier (GUID)<br>Distinguished name (DN)<br>Domain\\Account <br>User principal name (UPN)<br>LegacyExchangeDN<br>SMTP address<br>Alias | String   |

## Optional properties for the Create Move Request activity

| **Element**   | **Description**   | **Valid values** |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Accept Large Data Loss   | Specifies that a large amount of data loss is acceptable if the Bad Item Limit property is set to 51 or higher. An item is considered corrupted if it can't be read from the source database or can't be written to the target database. Corrupted items won't be available in the destination mailbox or .pst file. <br>Default is True, when selected.   | True, False   |
| Archive Domain   | Specifies the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the external domain to which the archive is moved. This property is used to move the archive to a cloud-based service.   | String   |
| Archive Only   | Specifies that only the personal archive associated with the mailbox is to be moved. This property can't be set to True when the Primary Only property is True.<br>Default is True, when selected.   | True, False   |
| Archive Target Database   | Specifies the target database for the new location of the personal archive. If a target database isn't specified, the archive is moved to the same database as the primary mailbox. If a target database isn't specified and the Archive Only property is True, the archive is moved to the homeMDB attribute of the primary mailbox. <br>This can be one of the following value types:<br>GUID of the database<br>Database name   | String   |
| Bad Item Limit   | Specifies the allowable number of bad items to skip if the request encounters corrupted items in the mailbox. Use 0 to not skip bad items. The valid input range for this property is from 0 through 2147483647. The default value is 0. <br> In general, you should keep the default value of 0 and only change the Bad Item Limit property value if the request fails.<br>If you set the Bad Item Limit property to more than 50 and the command fails due to excessive corrupt items, the system displays a warning: "Please confirm your intention to accept a large amount of data loss by specifying Accept Large Data Loss." If this occurs, you can run the command with the Accept Large Data Loss property set to True. No further warnings will appear and the corrupted items will become unavailable after the process is complete. | Integer   |
| Batch Name   | Specifies a descriptive name for moving a batch of mailboxes. The name can then be used in the Batch Name property as a search string for the Get Move Request mode.   | String   |
| Do Not Preserve Mailbox Signature | Specifies that the command won't preserve the mailbox mapping signature. <br>Generally, you should enable this property only if the move request fails due to depletion of Named Property identifiers. When this property is set to True, the mailbox user must restart Microsoft Outlook after the move request is complete. <br>Default is True, when selected.   | True, False   |
| Domain Controller   | Specifies the FQDN of the domain controller that writes this configuration change to Active Directory.   | String   |
| Ignore Rule Limit Errors   | Specifies that the command won't move the user's rules to the target server that runs Exchange.<br>Default is True, when selected.   | True, False   |
| MRS Server   | Specifies the FQDN of the Client Access server that runs the Microsoft Exchange Mailbox Replication service (MRS). This property is used for debugging purposes only.   | String   |
| Outbound   | Specifies that a cross-forest mailbox move is to be initiated from the source forest. <br>Default is True, when selected.   | True, False   |
| Primary Only   | Specifies that the command will only move the primary mailbox and won't move the personal archive. This property can't be set to True when the Archive Only property is True.<br>Default is True, when selected.   | True, False   |
| Remote   | Specifies that the move is outside the organization and that this move is being initiated from the target forest. This property can't be set to True when the Outbound property is True.<br>Default is True, when selected.   | True, False   |
| Remote Archive Target Database   | Specifies the name of the target database in the remote forest for the new location of the personal archive. Use this property to move users with archives from the local forest to a remote forest. For moves from a remote forest to the local forest, use the Archive Target Database property.<br>When you use this property, you must also specify the Remote or Remote Legacy property.   | String   |
| Remote Credential Password   | Specifies the password for the administrator identified in the Remote Credential User Name property.   | String   |
| Remote Credential User Name   | Specifies user name for an administrator who has permission to perform the mailbox move.   | String   |
| Remote Global Catalog   | Specifies the FQDN of the global catalog server for the remote forest.   | String   |
| Remote Host Name   | Specifies the FQDN of the cross-forest organization from which you're moving the mailbox.   | String   |
| Remote Legacy   | Specifies that this mailbox move is from a remote forest that doesn't have Exchange 2010 installed. <br>Default is True, when selected.   | True, False   |
| Remote Target Database   | Specifies the name of the target database in the remote forest. Use this property to move mailboxes from the local forest to a remote forest. For moves from a remote forest to the local forest, use the Target Database property.<br>When you use this property, you must also specify the Remote or Remote Legacy property.   | String   |
| Suspend   | Specifies whether to suspend the request. If you enable this property, the move request will be queued but won't reach the status of InProgress until the request is resumed.<br>Default is True, when selected.   | True, False   |
| Suspend Comment   | Specifies the reason for suspending the move request or other related comment. This property can only be used when the Suspend property is True.   | String   |
| Suspend When Ready To Complete   | Specifies whether to suspend the move request before it reaches the status of CompletionInProgress. After the move is suspended per this setting, it has a status of AutoSuspended. The move can then be manually completed with the Resume-MoveRequest command.<br>You can only use the Suspend When Ready To Complete property for online mailbox moves and when moving mailboxes from Exchange Server 2007 or Exchange 2010 mailbox databases. You can't use this property for offline moves or when moving from Exchange Server 2003 mailbox databases. <br>Default is True, when selected.   | True, False   |
| Target Database   | Specifies the identity of the database to which the mailbox is being moved. If the target database isn't specified, the command uses the automatic mailbox distribution logic to determine the target database. This can be one of the following value types:<br>GUID of the database<br>Database name   | String   |
| Target Delivery Domain   | Specifies the FQDN of the external email address that this move request creates in the source forest for the mail-enabled user. This property is allowed only to perform remote moves with the Remote or RemoteLegacy property.   | String   |
