# How to install System Center - Orchestrator

A complete Orchestrator installation includes a management server, one or more runbook servers, a SQL Server for hosting the Orchestrator database, a web server for hosting the Orchestrator web service, and a server for hosting the Runbook Designer and Runbook Tester. It is possible to install all these roles on a single computer, but it is more common to distribute the roles across several computers or virtual machines.

For a detailed description of the Orchestrator architecture, see [Learn about Orchestrator](learn-about-orchestrator.md).

This topic provides detailed installation instructions for the various Orchestrator roles.

## To install an Orchestrator management server

1.  On the server where you want to install Orchestrator, start the Orchestra Setup Wizard.

    To start the wizard on your product media or network share, double-click **SetupOrchestrator.exe**.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Before you begin setup, close any open programs and ensure that there are no pending restarts on the computer. For example, if you have installed a server role by using System Center - Service Manager or have applied a security update, you might have to restart the computer, and then log on to the computer with the same user account to finish the installation of the server role or the security update.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If User Account Control is enabled, then you will be prompted to verify that you want to allow the setup program to run. This is because it requires administrative access to make changes to the system.

2.  On the main page of the wizard, click **Install**.

    > [!WARNING]
    > If Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5 Service Pack 1 is not installed on your computer, a dialog box appears asking if you want to install .NET Framework 3.5 SP1. Click **Yes** to proceed with the installation.

3.  On the **Product registration** page, provide the name and company for the product registration, and then click **Next**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > For this evaluation release, a product key is not required.

4.  On the **Please read this License Terms** page, review and accept the Microsoft Software License Terms, and then click **Next**.

    On the **Diagnostic and Usage data** page, review the Diagnostic and Usage data notice, and then click **Next**.

5.  On the **Select features to install** page, ensure that **Management Server** is the only feature selected, and then click **Next**.

6.  Your computer is checked for required hardware and software. If your computer meets all of the requirements, the **All prerequisites are installed** page appears. Click **Next** and proceed to the next step.

    > [!NOTE]

    >  SQL Server Native Client is a prerequisite which is not validated by Prerequisite check step in setup. Hence, make sure that the SQL Server Native Client is installed on the Management server role. For more information, see the [Installing SQL Server Native Client](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/native-client/applications/installing-sql-server-native-client) topic on the Microsoft Docs website.

    If a prerequisite is not met, a page displays information about the prerequisite that has not been met and how to resolve the issue. Use the following steps to resolve the failed prerequisite check:

    1.  Review the items that did not pass the prerequisite check. For some requirements, such as Microsoft .NET Framework 4, you can use the link provided in the Setup Wizard to install the missing requirement. The Setup Wizard can install or configure other prerequisites, such as the Internet Information Services (IIS) role.

        > [!WARNING]

        > If you enable prerequisites during setup, such as Microsoft .NET Framework 4, your computer can require a restart. If you restart your computer, you must run setup again from the beginning.

    3.  After you resolve the missing prerequisites, click **Verify prerequisites again**.

    4.  Click **Next** to continue.

## To view runbook server properties

The properties for a runbook server include an optional description and the account information to use for the Runbook Service. You can modify the description but can only view the service credentials.    

1.  In the **Connections**  pane, select the Runbook Servers folder. In the right pane, right-click the runbook server to select **Properties**.  

2.  If you want to add or change the **Description** box, type a description for this runbook server, and then click **Finish**.


## Troubleshoot your installation

The following information provides additional instructions and caveats that you can use during installation to resolve problems you might experience.  

### Orchestrator log files  
If you experience problems during installation, installation log files are located in the folder **C:\\Users\\%USERNAME%\\AppData\\Local\\SCO\\LOGS**.  

If you experience problems when you are running Orchestrator, the product log files are located in the folder **C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft System Center <version>\\Orchestrator\\**.  

### Windows Firewall  
When you deploy additional Runbook Designer applications to your environment, you might see a failed installation message. To correctly install the Runbook Designer, enable the following firewall rules as they apply to your operating system and deployment configuration.  

### Windows Firewall with advanced security
By default, **Windows Firewall with Advanced Security** is enabled on all Windows Servercomputers, and blocks all incoming traffic unless it is a response to a request by the host, or it is specifically allowed. You can explicitly allow traffic by specifying a port number, application name, service name, or other criteria by configuring Windows Firewall with Advanced Security settings.  

Enable the following rules to allow all Monitor Event activities to function correctly:  

-   Windows Management Instrumentation \(Async\-In\)  

-   Windows Management Instrumentation \(DCOM\-In\)  

-   Windows Management Instrumentation \(WMI\-In\)  

### Automated deployment  
When a runbook server or Runbook Designer is installed behind a firewall, specific firewall rules are required between the remote computers that are used to deploy the runbook server and Runbook Designer. An additional rule is required for the remote connection between the Runbook Designer and the runbook server to allow the Orchestrator management service to accept remote connections. If you are using the **Monitor WMI** task, the runbook server requires a special firewall rule on the computer that uses PolicyModule.exe.  

Enable the following firewall rules on your computer:  

#### Firewall rule between the Runbook Designer and the Orchestrator management server  

|Operating system|Firewall rule|  
|--------------------|-----------------|  
|64\-bit|%ProgramFiles \(x86\)%\\Microsoft System Center <version>\\Orchestrator\\Management Server\\OrchestratorManagementService.exe|  
|32\-bit|%ProgramFiles%Microsoft System Center <version>\\Orchestrator\\Management Server\\OrchestratorManagementService.exe|  

#### Firewall rules between remote computers  

|Operating system|Firewall rules|  
|--------------------|------------------|  
|Windows Server |<ul><li>File and Printer Sharing</li><li>Windows Management Instrumentation \(WMI\)</li><li>Program rule for OrchestratorRemotingService to accept remote connections. This rule must be enabled through the Advanced Firewall mode:<br /><br /><ul><li>%SystemRoot%\\SysWOW64\\OrchestratorRemotingService.exe \(for a 64\-bit operating system\)</li><li>%SystemRoot%\\System32\\OrchestratorRemotingService.exe \(for a 32\-bit operating system\)</li></ul></li></ul>|  

#### Firewall rules between the runbook server and the computer that uses PolicyModule.exe  

|Operating system|Firewall rule|  
|--------------------|-----------------|  
|64\-bit|%ProgramFiles \(x86\)%\\Microsoft System Center <version>\\Orchestrator\\Runbook Server\\PolicyModule.exe|  
|32\-bit|%ProgramFiles\\Microsoft System Center <version>\\Orchestrator\\Runbook Server\\PolicyModule.exe|  

For more information about adding firewall rules, see [Add or Edit a Firewall Rule](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=201019).  

### <a name="BKMK_RunbookServicefailstostart"></a>RunbookService fails to start after computer reboot  
When you reboot your runbook server, the RunbookService attempts to connect to the orchestration database. If the database is not available, the RunbookService fails. The event log message is **This computer was unable to communicate with the computer providing the server.**. Typically, this can occur when the SQL server and the runbook server are installed on the same computer.  

To solve this problem. you can manually start the RunbookService, or configure the RunbookService to make multiple attempts during startup to connect to database before failing.  

### Cannot restart runbook service if you uninstall with an account without administrator permissions  
If you attempt to uninstall Orchestrator while logged in with an account that is a member of OrchestratorSystemGroup but is not an administrator, uninstall removes all accounts from OrchestratorSystemGroup. If you stop the runbook service and attempt to restart the service, the service fails because the user account does not have the correct permissions to retrieve the orchestration database connection. An account that is an administrator or a member of the OrchestratorSystemGroup is required to retrieve the orchestration database connection.  

To solve this problem, an administrator can add the user back to OrchestratorSystemGroup.
