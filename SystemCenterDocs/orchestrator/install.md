# Install System Center - Orchestrator

::: moniker range=">=sc-orch-2022"

A complete Orchestrator installation includes:

- a management server
- one or more runbook servers
- a SQL Server for hosting the Orchestrator database
- a web server for hosting the Orchestrator web API service
- a server for hosting the Runbook Designer and Runbook Tester
- a web server for hosting the Orchestration Console

It's possible to install all these roles and components on a single computer, but it's more common to distribute the roles across several computers or virtual machines.

For a detailed description of the Orchestrator architecture, see [Learn about Orchestrator](./learn-about-orchestrator.md).

This article provides detailed installation instructions for the various Orchestrator roles.

>[!NOTE]
>Install the [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable](/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170#visual-studio-2015-2017-2019-and-2022&preserve-view=true) package before running the Setup executable (SetupOrchestrator.exe).

## Install an Orchestrator management server

::: moniker range=">=sc-orch-2022"

1. On the server where you want to install the Orchestrator, install the [Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable](/cpp/windows/latest-supported-vc-redist?view=msvc-170#visual-studio-2015-2017-2019-and-2022&preserve-view=true) package and start the Orchestrator Setup Wizard.

    To start the wizard on your product media or network share, double-click **SetupOrchestrator.exe**.

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > Before you begin setup, close any open programs, and ensure that there are no pending restarts on the computer. For example, if you've installed a server role by using System Center - Service Manager or have applied a security update, you might have to restart the computer, and then sign in to the computer with the same user account to finish the installation of the server role or the security update.

    > [!NOTE]
    > If User Account Control is enabled, you will be prompted to verify that you want to allow the setup program to run. This is because it requires administrative access to make changes to the system.

2. On the main page of the wizard, select **Install**.

3. On the **Product registration** page, provide the name and company for the product registration, and select **Next**.

    > [!NOTE]

If a prerequisite isn't met, a page displays the information about the prerequisite that hasn't been met and how to resolve the issue. Use the following steps to resolve the failed prerequisite check:

1. Review the items that didn't pass the prerequisite check. For some requirements, such as Microsoft .NET Framework 4, you can use the link provided in the Setup Wizard to install the missing requirement. The Setup Wizard can install or configure other prerequisites, such as the Internet Information Services (IIS) role.

   > [!WARNING]
   > If you enable prerequisites during setup, such as Microsoft .NET Framework 4, your computer can require a restart. If you restart your computer, you must run setup again from the beginning.

2. After you resolve the missing prerequisites, select **Verify prerequisites again**.

3. Select **Next** to continue.

4. On the **Configure the service account** page, enter the username and password for the Orchestrator service account. Select **Test** to verify the account credentials. If the credentials are accepted, select **Next**.

## Secure connection to SQL server

Due to breaking changes in EFCore 8 and OLEDB 19, SQL Server connection is encrypted by default and requires a certificate that client can trust which means:
- The SQL Server must be configured with a valid certificate
- The client must trust this certificate

If these conditions aren't met, then a SqlException is thrown. For example:

A connection was successfully established with the server, but then an error occurred during the login process. (provider: SSL Provider, error: 0 - The certificate chain was issued by an authority that is not trusted.)

Following are the three ways to mitigate this error:

- Option 1: [Install a valid certificate on a server](/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/configure-sql-server-encryption?view=sql-server-ver16).
  
    >[!Note]
    > It is recommended to obtain a certificate and ensure it is signed by an authority trusted by the client.
    
- Option 2: `TrustServerCertificate=True` to allow bypassing the normal trust mechanism (not recommended). For more information, see [How encryption and certificate validation works](/sql/connect/oledb/features/encryption-and-certificate-validation?view=sql-server-ver16#encryption-and-certificate-validation-behavior).

    1. Set registry setting for Trust Server Certificate to **True** (Set this flag Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\MSSQLServer\Client\SNI19.0\GeneralFlags\Flag2). [Learn more](/sql/connect/oledb/features/registry-settings?view=sql-server-ver16#trust-server-certificate).
    1. During installation, check the checkbox **Yes, Trust Server Certificate (not recommended)**.
       Following configuration occurs:
          1. For SQL Connection string, adds *Trust Server Certificate=true*.
          1. In webapi.config, adds \<environmentVariable name="Database__TrustServerCertificate" value="true"/\>

       :::image type="content" source="media/install/configuration.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing configuration screen.":::

       Alternatively, On the **Data Store Configuration** page, in **Server**, enter `localhost;Trust Server Certificate=True` and this results in the following:


       :::image type="content" source="media/install/server-details.png" alt-text="Screenshot showing server details.":::


- Option 3: Use Data Store configuration to explicitly set *Server = localhost;Use encryption for Data=False* to the connection string (not recommended) to not encrypt the connection.

>[!Warning]
> Options 2 and 3 both leave the server in a potentially insecure state.

## Configure your installation

### Enable API logging to file

Toggle the XML attribute `stdoutLogEnabled` to `true` in your `web.config` under `system.WebServer` > `aspNetCore`.

Irrespective of this setting, you can view logs in **Event Viewer** > **Windows Applications** > **Applications**.

### Change your database settings for Web API

The API is configured using the `web.config` file as mentioned [here](/system-center/orchestrator/how-to-change-the-orchestrator-database#change-the-database-settings-for-the-orchestrator-web-service).

::: moniker-end

## Troubleshoot your installation

The following information provides additional instructions and caveats that you can use during the installation to resolve problems you might experience. 

### Orchestrator log files

If you experience problems during installation, installation log files are located in the folder **C:\\Users\\%USERNAME%\\AppData\\Local\\SCO\\LOGS**.  

If you experience problems when you're running Orchestrator, the product log files are located in the folder **C:\\ProgramData\\Microsoft System Center \<version\>\\Orchestrator\\**.  

### Windows Firewall

When you deploy additional Runbook Designer applications to your environment, you might see a failed installation message. To correctly install the Runbook Designer, enable the following firewall rules as they apply to your operating system and deployment configuration.  

### Windows Firewall with advanced security

By default, **Windows Firewall with Advanced Security** is enabled on all Windows Server computers, and blocks all incoming traffic unless it's a response to a request by the host or it's specifically allowed. You can explicitly allow traffic by specifying a port number, application name, service name, or other criteria by configuring Windows Firewall with Advanced Security settings.  

Enable the following rules to allow all Monitor Event activities to function correctly:  

- Windows Management Instrumentation \(Async\-In\)  

- Windows Management Instrumentation \(DCOM\-In\)  

- Windows Management Instrumentation \(WMI\-In\)  

### Automated deployment

When a runbook server or Runbook Designer is installed behind a firewall, specific firewall rules are required between the remote computers that are used to deploy the runbook server and Runbook Designer. An additional rule is required for the remote connection between the Runbook Designer and the runbook server to allow the Orchestrator management service to accept remote connections. If you're using the **Monitor WMI** task, the runbook server requires a special firewall rule on the computer that uses PolicyModule.exe.  

Enable the following firewall rules on your computer:  

#### Firewall rule between the Runbook Designer and the Orchestrator management server

### <a name="BKMK_RunbookServicefailstostart"></a>RunbookService fails to start after computer reboot  
When you reboot your runbook server, the RunbookService attempts to connect to the orchestration database. If the database isn't available, the RunbookService fails. The event log message is **This computer was unable to communicate with the computer providing the server**. Typically, this can occur when the SQL server and the runbook server are installed on the same computer.  

To solve this problem, you can manually start the RunbookService or configure the RunbookService to make multiple attempts during start-up to connect to database before failing.  

### Can't restart runbook service if you uninstall with an account without administrator permissions

If you attempt to uninstall Orchestrator while signed in with an account that is a member of OrchestratorSystemGroup but isn't an administrator, uninstall removes all accounts from OrchestratorSystemGroup. If you stop the runbook service and attempt to restart the service, the service fails because the user account doesn't have the correct permissions to retrieve the orchestration database connection. An account that is an administrator or a member of the OrchestratorSystemGroup is required to retrieve the orchestration database connection.  

To solve this problem, an administrator can add the user back to OrchestratorSystemGroup.
