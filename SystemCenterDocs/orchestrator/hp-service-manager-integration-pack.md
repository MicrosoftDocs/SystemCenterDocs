## Registering and Deploying the Integration Pack

After you download the integration pack file, you must register it with the Orchestrator management server and then deploy it to Runbook servers and Runbook Designers. For the procedures on installing integration packs, see [How To Install an Integration Pack](https://technet.microsoft.com/system-center-docs/orch/manage/how-to-add-an-integration-pack).

## Preparing to connect to the HP Service Manager Server

-   Make a record of the HP Service Manager server name and port number used to connect the HP Service Manager client.
-   For all HP Service Manager servers that you plan to connect to you must create an ODBC data source name (DSN) on each Client and Runbook server. Both SQL Server Native and Oracle ODBC connections are supported. See [Configuring the HP Service Manager Connections](#configuring-the-hp-service-manager-connections).
-   The licensing model for the components of HP Service Manager varies depending on the version installed. Consult the HP product documentation to determine which components are licensed separately. This integration pack requires HP Service Manager SOAP web service access to operate correctly. Ensure that this component is installed and licensed, if necessary.
-   Ensure that the user configured to access the HP Service Manager server has been assigned the SOAP-API CAPABILITY WORD in the HP Service Manager system. Depending on the version of HP Service Manager, it may be necessary to purchase extra licensing to enable the SOAP-API CAPABILITY WORD. Consult your HP Sales Representative for further information about licensing.

## Configuring the HP Service Manager Connections

A connection establishes a reusable link between Orchestrator and a HP Service Manager server. You can create as many connections as you require specifying links to multiple servers running HP Service Manager. You can also create multiple connections to the same server to allow for differences in security permissions for different user accounts.

The HP Service Manager integration pack requires a connection to the HP Service Manager SQL Server Database when designing runbooks in the Runbook Designer. A valid ODBC connection must be configured before setting up the HP Service Manager connection in the Runbook Designer.

To avoid possible corruption, do not use alternate means to directly connect to the database. Always use the ODBC connection to ensure a proper integration.

#### To set up a SQL Server ODBC connection

1.  Open the **ODBC Data Source Administrator Utility (32-bit)**. To access this utility, click **Start**, **Run**, and then type **\\Windows\\SysWOW64\\odbcad32.exe** in the **Open** box. Click **OK**.
2.  In the **ODBC Data Source Administrator**, click the **System DSN** tab.
3.  Click **Add**.
4.  Select the driver named **SQL Server Native Client 10.0** from the list of available drivers.

>[!TIP]
>For the DB Username and DB Password - If your HPSM database is on a computer running Windows server and you set up your ODBC DSN with Windows authentication, then you can enter anything in for the username and password because the fields are required only not to be blank in order for the Test Connection button to work.
>If you are using SQL Server authentication, then you must have the username and password for the HPSM SQL Server database. The user must have read/write access to the database via the DSN connection.

## Exposing Required Fields

If an activity reports an error and indicates that a required field must be specified but the IP does not provide the field in the user interface, the field must be exposed through the HP Service Manager Web service API. To expose the field complete the following procedure:

#### To expose a required field

1.  Open the HP Service Manager client.
2.  Connect to the desired HP Service Manager server.
3.  In the System Navigator, navigate to **Tailoring Tools**, then **Web Services**, then **WSDL Configuration** and double click the **WSDL Configuration** option.
4.  In the **External Access Definition** dialog click the **Search** button to list all available objects.
5.  Select the required object from the object list.
6.  Select the **Fields** tab.
7.  Scroll to the bottom of the **Field List**.
8.  Enter the database name of the field to be exposed in the **Field** column.
9.  Enter the name which the web service will refer to this field in the **Caption** column.
10. Ensure the data type is correct in the **Type** column.

## Known Issues


-   The **Test Connection** button cannot be used to validate Service Manager 7.1 web service connections if the HP ServiceCenter 6.2 web service has been disabled.
-   Certain permissions are required when dealing with Change tickets. These permissions are specified by assigning a user a Change Management Profile. While a user can have more than one profile, it can only belong to one profile per session. If the user is assigned more than one Change Management Profile it will automatically use the first profile in alphabetical order. To avoid confusion it is recommended that the user configured for use with the integration pack is only assigned one Change Management Profile.
-   The user configured for use with the integration pack must have its time zone preferences set to Greenwich/Universal with a date format of mm/dd/yy.
-   In certain versions of HP Service Manager the list of available categories when creating an incident displays Change yet choosing it causes the object to fail with the following message. Please provide a valid category. This is a known issue with the HP Service Manager server. Ensure that the fields are visible to the web service (See Troubleshooting) and that the HP Service Manager server is patched to the latest version.
-   The **Set as default** button available in the **Create Entry**, **Update Entry** and **Close Entry** activities may report an error when clicked. Use the following procedure to work around this issue.
    1.  Note the file path in the error message. For example, C:\\Users\\\[CurrentUser\]\\AppData\\Local\\Microsoft\\System Center 2012\\Orchestrator\\IntegrationPacks\\HPServiceManager\\\[GUID\]\\defaultFields.xml
    2.  Ensure that each of the folders in the file path exists exactly as shown in the error message.
    3.  Create any missing folders if necessary.

    if the Runbook Designer is launched by a user without administrative privileges on the computer. In the current version of the integration pack, ensure that the user has sufficient permissions to write to the **%COMMONPROGRAMFILES(x86)%\\Microsoft System Center 2012\\Orchestrator\\Extensions\\Support\\HPServiceManager\\** directory.
