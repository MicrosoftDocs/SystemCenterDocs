# REST integration pack guide 

The integration pack for Representational State Transfer (REST) is an add-on for System Center - Orchestrator that enables you to create activities within runbooks that make requests to REST web services to get data or perform functions.

- Microsoft is committed to protecting your privacy. See our [privacy statement](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement/EnterpriseDev/default.aspx).
- Depending on the communication protocol used, data that is passed to 3rd party systems could be intercepted from the wire and tampered with; for example, when the protocol between the Policy Module and the 3rd party product is HTTP. The user is responsible for choosing a secure protocol, such as HTTPS, for all data transmissions between Orchestrator and any other product.
