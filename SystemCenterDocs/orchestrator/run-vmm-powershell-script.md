# Run VMM PowerShell Script

The Run VMM PowerShell activity is used to call any PowerShell activity.

## Run VMM PowerShell Script required properties

| Element   | Description   | Valid Values |
|:---|:---|:---|
| PowerShell Script  | The PowerShell script to execute   | $x = 4;   |
| Output Variable 01 | Use a variable name defined in your script that you want to return as Published Data. You can use either the PowerShell notation **$var1** or the variable name **var1**. The value of an element must be a simple type value and not an object or collection of objects. You can't specify an object property, such as $var1.propertyname, as an output element. The name in the output element must be the name of an actual PowerShell variable. If the PowerShell variable contains a complex type or a collection of objects, the data returned is similar to **System.Object** or **System.Object\[\]** because the contents of the output variable can't be represented as a string. | $x   |
