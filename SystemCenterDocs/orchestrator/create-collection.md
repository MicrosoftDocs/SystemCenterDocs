# Create collection activity for System Center 2016 Configuration Manager

The Create Collection activity is used in a runbook to create a new
Configuration Manager user or device collection. Collections are the
primary means of defining targets for Configuration Manager actions such
as application or software update deployments.

Once a collection is created, its membership must be defined by adding
collection membership rules using the **Add Collection Rule** activity.
Membership rules can be removed from the collection by using the
**Delete Collection Rule** activity. To force reevaluation of the
collection’s membership after adding or removing collection rules, use
the **Update Collection Membership** activity.

## Properties and published data

The following list describes the properties and published data for this
activity. The activity publishes all the data from the required and
optional properties into published data.

## Create collection properties

- Collection Name: The desired display name of the collection to be created.

- Collection Type: Specifies the type of collection to create. Options are:

  - **Device** (default): the collection contains device resources

  - **User**: the collection contains user resources

- Limiting Collection: The display name or ID of an existing collection that will limit the membership of the new collection.

When you use the browse feature to look up a collection name, or enter a collection name manually or from published data, you must set the **Collection Value Type** property to **Name** or the activity will fail.

- Limiting Collection Value Type: Specifies whether the value in the Limiting Collection property is a name or a collection ID. Options are:

  - **ID** (default): the value is a collection ID

  - **Name**: the value is a collection name

- Comment: Optional descriptive text about the collection

- Use Incremental Updates: True or False (Default = True) Incremental updates periodically evaluate new resources and then add resources to this collection without full updates being required.

## Create collection published data

- Collection ID: Provides the Collection ID value for the collection targeted for this activity (in case the collection name was specified for the input property).
- Connection: Specifies the name of the connection to the Configuration Manager server

      activity in the runbook.
