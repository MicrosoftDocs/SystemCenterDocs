You can use the Create Remote Mailbox (Hybrid) activity to create a mail-enabled user in on-premises Active Directory and Exchange. An associated mailbox is also created in the cloud-based service (hybrid environment).

The following tables list the required properties, optional properties, and published data for this activity.

## Required properties for Create Remote Mailbox (Hybrid)

| **Element**         | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | **Valid Values** |

| Immutable ID                    | This property is used by GAL Synchronization (GALSync). It specifies a unique and immutable identifier in the form of an SMTP address for an Exchange mailbox that is used for federated delegation when requesting Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) tokens. <br>If federation is configured for this mailbox and this property is not configured when creating the mailbox, Exchange will create the value for the immutable identifier based upon the mailbox's ExchangeGUID and the federated account namespace. For example: 7a78e7c8-620e-4d85-99d3-c90d90f29699@mail.contoso.com. <br>The Immutable ID property must be configured if Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) is deployed to allow single sign-on into an off-premises mailbox and AD FS is configured to use a different attribute than ExchangeGUID for sign-on token requests. Exchange and AD FS must both request the same token for the same user to ensure proper functionality for a cross-premise Exchange deployment scenario. | String                        |
