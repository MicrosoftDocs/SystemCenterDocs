| Ignore Default Scope                         | Instructs the command to ignore the default recipient scope setting for the Exchange Management Shell session, and use the entire forest as the scope. This allows the command to access the Active Directory objects that aren't currently in the default scope. Using this property introduces the following restrictions:<br>You can't use the Domain Controller property. The command uses an appropriate global catalog server automatically.<br>You can only use the DN for the Identity property. Other forms of identification, such as alias or GUID, aren't accepted.<br>Default value is True, when selected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | True, False                             |
| Immutable ID                                 | Used by Outlook Live Directory Sync (OLSync) and specifies a unique and immutable identifier in the form of an SMTP address for an Exchange mailbox that's used for federated delegation when requesting Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) tokens. If federation is configured for this mail-enabled user and you don't set this property when you create the mailbox, Exchange creates the value for the immutable identifier based upon the mailbox's ExchangeGUID and the federated account namespace; for example, 7a78e7c8-620e-4d85-99d3-c90d90f29699@mail.contoso.com. You must set the Immutable ID property if Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) is deployed to allow single sign-on into off-premises mailboxes, and AD FS is configured to use a different attribute than ExchangeGUID for sign-on token requests. Both, Exchange and AD FS must request the same token for the same user, to ensure proper functionality for cross-premise Exchange organizations. | String                                  |
| Mail Tip Translations                        | Specifies additional languages when you want to provide the MailTip property information for this recipient in multiple languages. For each language, you must provide the locale, followed by a colon, and the specific MailTip property message in that language. Each MailTip property message must be less than or equal to 250 characters. Multiple languages can be separated by commas.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | String                                  |
| Moderated By                                 | Specifies the users that are responsible for moderating the messages that are sent to the mail-enabled user. To designate more than one user, separate the users with commas.<br>This property is required when the Moderation Enabled property to set to value True. If the value isn't specified and there's a user already specified as the manager of this mail-enabled user, the Moderated By property is automatically set by the Managed By property of the distribution group.
