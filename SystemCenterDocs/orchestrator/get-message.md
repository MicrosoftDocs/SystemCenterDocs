# Get Message

The Get Message activity retrieves message from a management server according to filter criteria that you specify. The activity uses filters to determine which messages retrieved from the management server should be published.

The following tables list the required properties and published data for this activity. For more information on configuring activities, see [HP Operations Manager Activities](operations-manager-activities.md).

>[!TIP]
>The **Get Message** activity can only retrieve Active messages from the HP Operations Manager management server.

>[!TIP]
>The maximum number of Messages that can be returned by the Get Message activity is determined by the HP Operations Manager Web Service **MaxItemsMaximum** configuration parameter. The **MaxItemsMaximum** configuration parameter has a default value of 500, however this can be increased up to 5,000 as directed in the HP Operations Manager Web Services Integration Manager documentation.

>[!TIP]
>When editing filters for numeric fields, the **Filter Settings** dialog may change the **Is less than** and **Is greater than** relations to **Is less than or equal to** and **Is greater than or equal to**. To avoid inadvertently modifying the filter, click **Cancel** to dismiss the Filter Settings dialog without committing the change.
