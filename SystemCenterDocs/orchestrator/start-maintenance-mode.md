# Start Maintenance Mode

The Start Maintenance Mode activity puts a monitor in Operations Manager into maintenance mode. All alerts generated by computers watched by the monitor while in maintenance mode will be ignored. You can use the Start Maintenance Mode activity at the start of maintenance procedures to prevent false alerts from being generated.

If you choose to put a computer (Microsoft.Windows.Computer or Microsoft.Unix.Computer) into maintenance mode, then all child monitors for that computer will also be put in maintenance mode.

The activity publishes all the data from the required and optional properties into published data.
