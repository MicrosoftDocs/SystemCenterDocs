# System Center - Orchestrator Integration Toolkit

The System Center Orchestrator Integration Toolkit is a set of tools to help you create new integrations for Orchestrator. Using wizard-based applications, you can easily create new workflow activities and Integration Packs that extend the capabilities of the product. You can also create custom workflow activities using the Orchestrator SDK and C#, and then package them into an Integration Pack using this toolkit. This document describes the contents of the System Center Orchestrator Integration Toolkit, how to use the utilities in the Toolkit, and special procedures for migrating activities and Integration Packs from previous versions to be compatible with System Center Orchestrator.  

 For more information about the role of integration packs and for other options for building custom solutions with Orchestrator, see the [System Center 2012 Integration Guide on TechNet Wiki](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=275796).
