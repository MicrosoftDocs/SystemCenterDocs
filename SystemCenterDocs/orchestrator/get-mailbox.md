You can use the Get Mailbox activity to retrieve the attributes and objects for a mailbox in an on-premises or online environment. The Get Mailbox activity lets you filter against various mailbox attributes.

This activity calls the Exchange Get-Mailbox PowerShell cmdlet to do the underlying work. For more information, see [this article](/powershell/module/exchange/get-mailbox) about the Get-Mailbox cmdlet that shares the same parameter set.

The following tables list the required properties, filters, optional properties, and published data for this activity.

## Required properties for the Get Mailbox activity

This activity has no required properties.

## Filters for the Get Mailbox activity

The values in this section are used to filter the results returned from the underlying call to the Exchange Get-Mailbox PowerShell cmdlet.

The filter values mentioned here only filter the returned results from the cmdlet and don't pass any values specified here as parameters to the underlying cmdlet.

### Optional properties for the Get Mailbox activity

The values in this section directly correlate to the parameter values defined for the Exchange Get-Mailbox PowerShell cmdlet. The only exceptions are the **Active Directory Password** and **Active Directory User Name** values, which correlate to the **Credential** parameter of the cmdlet.

If the value specified for any of these optional properties is empty or null, (null is the default value) the parameter switch won't be passed to the cmdlet.

| Element   | Description   | Valid values |

| Active Directory Password   | The password to use in order to access Active Directory.   | String   |
| Active Directory User Name  | Specifies the user name to use in order to access Active Directory.   | String   |

| Arbitration   | Indicates whether the mailbox for which the command is executed is an arbitration mailbox. Arbitration mailboxes are used for managing approval workflow. For example, an arbitration mailbox is used for handling moderated recipients and distribution group membership approval. Default is True, when selected.   | True, False  |
| Archive   | Indicates whether to return information about the recipient's archive mailbox. Default is True, when selected.   | True, False  |
| Database   | The database (GUID or database name) from which to get the mailbox. This property can't be used with activity filters.   | String   |
| Domain Controller   | The fully qualified domain name (FQDN) of the domain controller that retrieves data from Active Directory.   | String   |

This setting allows the command to access Active Directory objects that aren't currently in the default scope. Using the Ignore Default Scope property introduces the following restrictions:<br>Domain Controller property can't be used. The command uses an appropriate global catalog server automatically.<br>The DN for the Identity property can't be used. Other forms of identification, such as alias or GUID, aren't accepted.<br>The Organizational Unit and Identity properties can't be used together.<br>The Active Directory Name and Password properties can't be used.<br>Default is True, when selected.   | True, False  |
| Mailbox Plan   | Specifies the Get activity to return mailboxes associated with this mailbox plan. A mailbox plan specifies the permissions and features available to a mailbox user.

| Read From Domain Controller | Specifies that the user information is read from a domain controller in the user's domain. When the recipient scope is set to include all recipients in the forest and this property is not configured, it is possible that the user information is read from a global catalog containing outdated information. If you use this property, multiple reads might be necessary to get the information. By default, the recipient scope is set to the domain that hosts your servers that run Exchange. <br>Default is True, when selected.   | True, False  |
| Recipient Type Details   | This property specifies the type of recipients returned by the Get activity. Recipient types are divided into recipient types and subtypes. <br>Each recipient type contains all common properties for all subtypes. For example, the type UserMailbox represents a user account in Active Directory that has an associated mailbox. Because there are several mailbox types, each mailbox type is identified by the RecipientTypeDetails property. For example, a conference room mailbox has RecipientTypeDetails set to RoomMailbox, whereas a user mailbox has RecipientTypeDetails set to UserMailbox.<br>This property accepts the following values:<br>RoomMailbox <br>EquipmentMailbox <br>LegacyMailbox <br>LinkedMailbox <br>UserMailbox <br>DiscoveryMailbox <br>SharedMailbox | String   |
