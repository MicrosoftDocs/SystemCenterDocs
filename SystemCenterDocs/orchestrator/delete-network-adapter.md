The Delete Network Adapter activity is used in a runbook to remove a virtual network adapter from a virtual machine controlled by the VMware vSphere server. The network adapter to remove is identified by its MAC address. A list of MAC addresses associated with a virtual machine can be found using the Get VM Properties activity.

The following tables list the required and optional properties and the published data for this activity. The activity publishes all the data from the required and optional properties into published data. Additional published data is generated based on the class that you select when you define the activity.

### Required properties

| Element   | Description   | Valid values | Look up |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| VM Path   | The path of the virtual machine containing the adapter to delete.   | String   | Yes   |
| MAC Address | The MAC address of the network adapter to remove. The formats "00:11:22:33:44:55" and "00-11-22-33-44-55" are accepted. | String   | No   |
