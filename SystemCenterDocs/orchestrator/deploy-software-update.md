# Deploy Software Update activity for Configuration Manager Integration Pack

The Deploy Software Update activity is used in a runbook to create a
Software Deployment (advertisement) to deploy software updates to a
collection of computers. This activity requires that the updates have
been downloaded and the following items exist on the Configuration
Manager Site:

- Deployment Template
- Deployment Package

## Properties and published data

The following tables list the properties and published data for this
activity.

## Deploy Software Update properties

- Deployment Name: The desired name for the new deployment that will be shown in the Configuration Manager console
- Deployment Description: An optional description (comment) for the new deployment
- Deployment Template: The display name or ID of an existing deployment template. The template allows you to predefine many settings for a deployment without having to manually specify them in the activity.

    This property is optional if you choose instead to manually define the settings by using all of the optional properties.
    >[!NOTE]
    >When you use the browse feature to look up a template name or enter a template name manually or from published data, you must set the **Deployment Template Value Type** property to **Name** or the activity will fail.
- Deployment Template Value Type: Specifies whether the value in the **Deployment Template** property is a name or a template ID. Options are:
    - **ID** (default): the value is a template ID
    - **Name**: the value is a template name
- Update/Update Group: The display name or ID of an existing software update group or individual software update.
    >[!NOTE]
    >The browse feature will allow you to select a software update group by name. Individual software updates are not shown in the browser.
- Update Value Type: Specifies whether the value in the **Update / Update Group** property is a name or an ID. The options are:
    - **Update Group Name** (default): The value is an update group name
    - **Update Group ID**: The value is an ID
    - **Update Name**: The value is the name of an individual update
    - **Update ID**: The value is the CI\_ID of an individual update
- Purpose: The deployment intent or purpose. The options are:
  - **Required** (default): The application is mandatory to be installed or uninstalled
  - **Available**: The application is made available but isn't mandatory

    >[!NOTE]
    >When this property is set to **Required**, a mandatory schedule must be defined on the **Schedule** tab or the activity will fail.
- User Notification: Determines how the end-user sees the deployment and its notifications. The options are:
  - **Show all notifications** (default): The deployment is listed in the Software Center and all the notifications are displayed to the user.
  - **Show only restart notifications**: The deployment isn't listed in the Software Center, but notifications about a required reboot are displayed to the user.
  - **Hide all notifications**: The deployment isn't listed in the Software Center, and the notifications about a required reboot aren't displayed to the user.

    >[!NOTE]
    >If you set this property to **Hide all notifications** and the **Purpose** property is set to **Available**, this property will automatically be reset to **Show only restart notifications** because Configuration Manager disallows that setting.
- Collection: The display name or ID of an existing collection.

    >[!NOTE]
    >When you use the browse feature to look up a collection name or enter a collection name manually or from published data, you must set the **Collection Value Type** property to Name or the activity will fail.
- Collection Value Type: Specifies whether the value in the Collection property is a name or a collection ID. The options are:
    - **ID** (default): the value is a collection ID
    - **Name**: the value is a collection name

## Deploy Software Update optional properties

- Allow peer client distribution: True or False (Default = True) Select this option to reduce the load on the network by allowing clients to download content from other clients on the network that have already downloaded and cached the content. This option utilizes Windows BranchCache and can be used on computers running Windows Vista SP2 and later.
- Allow Software Install Outside of Maintenance Windows: True or False (Default = False) Allows the application to install even if the installation would occur outside of a maintenance window
- Allow System Restart Outside of Maintenance Windows: True or False (Default = False) Allows the advertised program to restart the client even if the restart would occur outside of a maintenance window
- Detail Level: Specified the level of information reported in state messages about the deployment. Options are:
    - **Normal** (default): Returns all state messages related to the deployment.
    - **Minimal**: Returns only enforcement success and critical error messages.
- Send Wake-up Packets: True or False (Default = False) Specifies whether the Configuration Manager server will send a Wake On LAN packet to the computer prior to the advertised program.
    >[!NOTE]
    >This setting applies only if the **Purpose** is set to **Required**.
- Slow boundary deployment option: Specifies the options available when the client is within a slow or unreliable network boundary. The options are:
    - **Do not run program** (default): The program won't be run when a client is connected within a slow or unreliable network boundary.
    - **Download content and run locally**: The client will download the content from the Distribution Point before attempting to run the program.
- Allow unprotected distribution point: True or False (Default = False) Specifies whether Configuration Manager will permit a client to use an unprotected distribution point if the content isn't immediately available on its protected distribution point, or if it forces a client to use the protected local distribution point if it is within the boundaries for that point.
- Suppress Restart on Servers: True or False (Default = False) When set to **True**, prevents the automatic restart of servers after update installation.
- Suppress Restart on Workstations: True or False (Default = False) When set to **True**, prevents the automatic restart of workstations after update installation.
- Comment: An optional comment associated with the deployment.
- Fast (LAN) boundary deployment option: Specifies how a program is run when the client is connected within a fast (LAN) network boundary. The options are:
    - **Download content and run locally** (default): The client will download the content from the Distribution Point before attempting to run the program.
    - **Run program from Distribution Point**: The client will run the program from the Distribution Point without downloading it first.

4. Configuring the **Schedule** tab:

   The **Schedule** tab allows you to define when the deployment becomes available or when it expires, as well as mandatory assignment schedules. Mandatory assignment schedules cause Configuration Manager to automatically run the program at a specific time or according to a specific event, such as user Logon/Logoff. The settings on this tab are optional.

   >[!NOTE]
   >When a deployment is set to **Required**, then a mandatory schedule must be defined for the deployment or the activity will fail.

5. Configuring the **Alerts** tab:

   The **Alerts** tab allows you to define compliance and installation alert features for a deployment. The settings on this tab are optional. To configure the settings on this tab, enter the appropriate values as described in the properties list above.
