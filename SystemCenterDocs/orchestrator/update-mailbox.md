This property modifies the mandatory properties of a mailbox in this state to correct the problem and remove the legacy mailbox tag from the mailbox.<br>Default is True, when selected. <br><br><strong>Note </strong><br> This property is available only in an on-premise environment. <br><br>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | True, False                                                                                                                            |

| Ignore Default Scope                         | Instructs the command to ignore the default recipient scope setting for the Exchange Management Shell session, and to use the entire forest as the scope. This allows the command to access Active Directory objects that aren't currently in the default scope. Using this property introduces the following restrictions:<br>You can't use the DomainController property. The command uses an appropriate global catalog server automatically.<br>You can only use the DN for the Identity property. Other forms of identification, such as alias or GUID, are not accepted.<br>Default value is True, when selected. <br><br><strong>Note </strong><br> This property is available only in an on-premises environment. <br><br>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | True, False                                                                                                                            |
| Immutable ID                                 | This property is used by Outlook Live Directory Sync (OLSync) and it specifies a unique and immutable identifier. This identifies is in the form of an SMTP address for an Exchange mailbox that's used for federated delegation when requesting Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) tokens. If the federation is configured for this mailbox and you do not set this property when you create the mailbox, Exchange will create the value for the immutable ID based upon the mailbox's ExchangeGUID and the federated account namespace. For example, 7a78e7c8-620e-4d85-99d3-c90d90f29699@mail.contoso.com. You must set the Immutable ID property if Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) is deployed to allow single sign-on into off-premises mailboxes and if AD FS is configured to use a different attribute than ExchangeGUID for sign-on token requests. Both, Exchange and AD FS must request the same token for the same user to ensure proper functionality for a cross-premise Exchange deployment scenario. | String                                                                                                                                 |
| Issue Warning Quota                          | Specifies the mailbox size at which a warning message is sent to the user if that size is exceeded The mailbox size must be either an integer or unlimited.<br>If you set this attribute on a mailbox, that mailbox setting overrides the value set for this attribute on the mailbox database. <br><br><strong>Note </strong><br> This property is not available in the Live@edu environment. <br><br>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | String                                                                                                                                 |
| Languages                                    | Specifies the language preferences for this mailbox, in order of preference.

Some of those components include quota messages, non-delivery reports (NDRs), the Outlook Web App user interface, and Unified Messaging (UM) voice prompts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | String                                                                                                                                 |
