# Workflow Control
When you build runbooks in [!INCLUDE[orchlong](./Token/orchlong_md.md)], it is important to understand the underlying logic of the workflow engine. By using this logic, you can create workflows to automate resource\-based jobs and complex data processing tasks.

## Workflow Control
The workflow control provides the following controls.

-   [Starting Point](./Starting-Point.md)

-   [Smart Links](./Smart-Links.md)

-   [Embedded Loops](./Embedded-Loops.md)
