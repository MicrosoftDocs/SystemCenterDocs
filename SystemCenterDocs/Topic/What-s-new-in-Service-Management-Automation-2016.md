# What&#39;s new in Service Management Automation 2016
The following new features are available in Service Management Automation (SMA) 2016.  

**Support for PowerShell script**
SMA 2016 now supports PowerShell Script in addition to PowerShell Workflow which was the only runbook format supported in previous versions.  

**PowerShell ISE add-on**
The Service Management Automation (SMA) PowerShell ISE add-on makes it easier to author and test your runbooks in your local PowerShell ISE environment.

**Specify a runbook worker**
By default, SMA randomly picks a Runbook worker to service a job when a Runbook is invoked.     SMA 2016 adds a property to a runbook that specifies a particular runbook worker it should run on.

**Support for PowerShell 5.0**
Service Management Automation 2016 now supports Windows Management Framework 5.0.
