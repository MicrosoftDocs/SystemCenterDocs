# Configuring Change and Activity Management in System Center 2016 - Service Manager_1
As part of your initial configuration of [!INCLUDE[scsm_threshold_1](../Token/scsm_threshold_1_md.md)], you have to configure settings and workflows for change and activity management. Create a change request template that you can use later when new change requests are submitted.

Configure workflows to automatically close completed change requests and send notifications to users when activities require approval. Workflows automate processes that you can use to automatically apply templates and send notifications.

A change request template is useful when you create a change request for a recurring type of issue because you can set an issue category and define a standard priority, effect, and risk level for it in the template. You can also create additional templates for other types of recurring change requests. Another benefit of creating a change request template is that users spend less time when they submit new change requests.
