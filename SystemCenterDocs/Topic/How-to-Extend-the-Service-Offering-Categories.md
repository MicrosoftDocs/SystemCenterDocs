# How to Extend the Service Offering Categories
By default, Service Manager includes only the General service offering category. However, your organization will likely need additional categories to help organize service offerings that are provided to end users through the service catalog. You can use the following procedure to add additional categories to the service catalog.

### To extend the service offering categories

1.  In the [!INCLUDE[smcons](../Token/smcons_md.md)], click **Library**.

2.  In the **Library** pane, click **Lists**, and then in the **Filter** box, type **offering**.

3.  In the **Lists** view, select **Service Offering Category**, and then in the **Tasks** list under **Service Offering Category**, click **Properties**.

4.  In the **List Properties** dialog box, add any service offering categories that you want, and then click **OK** to close the dialog box. For example, add the following categories:

    -   **Data Center**

    -   **Access and Security**

    -   **Communication Services**

5.  Click **OK** to close the **List Properties** dialog box.
