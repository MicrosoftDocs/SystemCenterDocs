# Tweak performance settings
The topics in this section define performance expectations and explain how to optimize [!INCLUDE[dpm2012long](../Token/dpm2012long_md.md)] performance. Network speed, the performance characteristics of the protected computer, the size of your protected data, and the rate at which the protected data changes will determine your actual results.
