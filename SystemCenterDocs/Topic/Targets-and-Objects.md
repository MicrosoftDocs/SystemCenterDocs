# Targets and Objects
An *object* is the basic unit of management in [!INCLUDE[om12short](../Token/om12short_md.md)]. An object typically represents something in your computing environment, such as a computer, a logical disk, or a database. A *class* represents a kind of object, and every object in [!INCLUDE[om12short](../Token/om12short_md.md)] is considered an *instance* of a particular class. A *target* in the Operations console represents all instances of a particular class.

The following sections provide further detail on these concepts and guidance for selecting target and created new classes.
