# How to Customize a List Item
The items in a list in a sealed management pack in [!INCLUDE[smlong12](../Token/smlong12_md.md)] cannot be changed. In this example, you will add a list item \(phone\) to the **Service Request Source** list and save it into an unsealed management pack, and then edit the new view by changing its name to **New Failed Service Requests**. You will finish this exercise by hiding the original Failed Service Requests view. As an administrator, you will still see the hidden view.

### To customize a list item

1.  In the [!INCLUDE[smcons](../Token/smcons_md.md)], click **Library**.

2.  In the **Library** pane, expand **Library**, and then click **Lists**.

3.  In the **Lists** pane, click **Service Request Source**.

4.  In the **Tasks** pane, in the **Service Request Source** area, click **Properties**.

5.  In the **List Properties** dialog box, click **Add Item**.

6.  In the **Select management pack** dialog box, accept the default management pack, **Service Manager Service Request Configuration Library**, and then click **OK**.

7.  In the **List Properties** dialog box, click **List Value**.

8.  In the **Name** field, type **Phone**, and then click **OK**.
