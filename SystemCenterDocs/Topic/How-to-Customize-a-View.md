# How to Customize a View
The **Failed Service Requests** view in [!INCLUDE[smlong12](../Token/smlong12_md.md)] is in a sealed management pack. In this example, you will create a duplicate of this view, save it into an unsealed management pack, and then edit the new view by changing its name to **New Failed Service Requests**. You will finish this exercise by hiding the original Failed Service Requests view. As an administrator, you will still see the hidden view.

### To customize a view

1.  In the [!INCLUDE[smcons](../Token/smcons_md.md)], click **Work Items**.

2.  In the **Work Items** pane, expand **Service Request Fulfillment**.

3.  Right\-click **Failed Service Requests**, and then click **Duplicate View**.

4.  In the **Select management pack** dialog box, accept the default management pack, **Service Manager Service Request Configuration Library**, and then click **OK**.

5.  Right\-click **Failed Service Requests – Copy**, and then click **Edit View**.

6.  In the Edit Failed Service Requests – Copy Wizard, in **Name**, type a new name for this view. For example, type **New Failed Service Requests**, and then click **OK**.

7.  Right\-click **Failed Service Requests**, and then click **Hide View**.
