# Managing a self-service environment for tenants
The procedures in this section explain how to create a self\-service user role that can create, deploy, and use virtual machines and services on one or more private clouds in [!INCLUDE[vmm12sp1_long](Token/vmm12sp1_long_md.md)]. The procedures also explain how to share [!INCLUDE[vmm12short](Token/vmm12short_md.md)] resources as a self\-service user, if permissions have been set up for you to share these resources with other self\-service users.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> App Controller can also be used as a self\-service portal. For more information, see[App Controller](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/hh546834.aspx).
