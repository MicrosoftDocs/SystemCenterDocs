# How to View Workflow Success or Failure
Use the following procedure to view the success or failure instances of the workflows.

### To view workflow success or failure

1.  In the [!INCLUDE[smcons](../Token/smcons_md.md)], click **Administration**.

2.  In the **Administration** pane, expand **Administration**, expand **Workflows**, and then click **Status**.

3.  In the **Status** pane, click the workflow that you want to view. For example, click **Escalates Printer Problems to Support Tier 2 when the Urgency property is changed to High**.

4.  In the **Status** results pane, click **Need attention** to view workflows that did not run successfully. Or, click **All Instances**, and then do the following:

    1.  Click **View log** to view the list of events that occurred when the workflow ran.

    2.  Click **View related object** to view the form that was used when the workflow ran.

    The status of each workflow is displayed in the **Status** column.

![](../Image/PSSymbol.gif)You can use a Windows PowerShell command to complete this task. For information about how to use WindowsÂ PowerShell to retrieve the status of workflows in [!INCLUDE[smshort](../Token/smshort_md.md)], see [Get\-SCSMWorkflowStatus](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=225347).
