# System Center 2016 - Operations Manager Operations Guide

>Applies To: System Center 2016 - Operations Manager

Operations Manager, a component of System Center 2016, enables you to monitor services, devices, and operations for many computers in a single console. Operators can gain rapid insight into the state of the IT environment and the IT services running across different systems and workloads by using numerous views that show state, health, and performance information, as well as alerts generated for availability, performance, configuration and security situations.

This section is a comprehensive resource that can be used to understand and use Operations Manager. It covers administrative, monitoring, reporting, and operating tasks typically performed by an administrator or operator. It follows the Operations Manager Deploy section in order of use during an Operations Manager implementation project, but does not assume that the administrator or operator participated in the installation of the Operations Manager infrastructure.
