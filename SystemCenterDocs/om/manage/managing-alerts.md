# Managing Alerts

>Applies To: System Center 2016 - Operations Manager

An alert is an indication of a significant event requiring attention. Rules and monitors can generate alerts. You can view alerts in the **Monitoring** workspace of the Operations console or web console.  
  
## Managing Alerts topics  
  
-   To understand how Operations Manager monitors the communication channel between an agent and it's primary management server to ensure it is responsive and available, see [How Heartbeats Work in Operations Manager](How-Heartbeats-Work.md).  

-  To get better visibility with the alerts being generated in your environment and determine which are candidates for additional configuration to reduce alert noise and improve alert accuracy, see [Data-driven Alert Management](data-driven-alert-management.md) from the Operations console.
