# Getting information from Operations Manager

>Applies To: System Center 2016 - Operations Manager

Operations Manager, a component of System Center 2016, collects an immense amount of information about your environment, such as events, performance data, health states, and availability. To use Operations Manager effectively, you need to know how to get the information that is important to you.
