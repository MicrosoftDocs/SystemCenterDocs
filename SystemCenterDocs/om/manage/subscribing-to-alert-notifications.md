# Subscribing to alert notifications

>Applies To: System Center 2016 - Operations Manager

In System Center 2016 - Operations Manager, when an alert is generated, Operations Manager can notify designated individuals by email, instant message (IM), or text message (SMS). Notifications can also run commands automatically when an alert is raised on a monitored system.  
  
A notification requires the following elements:  
  
-   A Run As account that provides credentials to the Notification Account Run As profile.  
  
-   A notification channel which defines the format for the notification and the method by which the notification is sent.  
  
-   A notification subscriber which defines the recipients and the schedule for sending notifications to the subscriber.  
  
-   A notification subscription which defines the criteria for sending a notification, the channel to be used, and the subscribers to receive the notification.  
  
An Operations Manager administrator must define the notification channels and if authentication is required, configure the Run As account for notifications. An Operations Manager administrator, advanced operator, or operator can create a subscriber and a subscription.
