# Using the Visio Add-in and SharePoint Visio Services Data Provider

>Applies To: System Center 2016 - Operations Manager

The Visio Add-in for System Center 2016 - Operations Manager combines the strengths of two applications widely used in enterprise IT to simplify the creation of customized dashboards that show the health of an environment. The Visio Add-in lets you create diagrams in Visio 2010, 2013, and 2016 that shows:

- Objects by geography on a map, by location in a data center or building
- By role in a logical view of an application
- By topology for complex distributed applications or a core infrastructure technology such as Active Directory Domain Services
  
The SharePoint Visio Services Data Provider for System Center 2016 - Operations Manager enables you to take the customized dashboards you create with the Visio Add-in and include them in SharePoint 2010, 2013, and 2016 Web sites. These Web-based dashboards are updated and provide access to instant status information through the familiar SharePoint browser-based experience.  

The Visio Add-in and SharePoint  Visio Services Data Provider have the following features:  
  
-   Distributed applications exported from Operations Manager as Visio documents automatically show live health state information on the exported objects when opened in Microsoft Visio.  
  
-   You can easily create new Visio documents and link shapes to any managed object (such as a computer, database, Web site, or perspective) to show the current health state.  
  
-   You can automatically link entire existing Visio documents to the computer and to network devices managed by Operations Manager by matching computer names or IP addresses.  
  
-   Health states can be automatically refreshed in Visio documents. You can use this option along with Visio's full-screen view to create dashboard views suitable for use as a summary display in a data center control room.  
  
-   Predefined data graphics enable you to switch from Operations Manager health icons to the shape color for health state.  
  
-   Health states can be automatically refreshed in published Visio documents that are hosted in SharePoint document libraries, when the Visio Services data provider for System Center 2016 - Operations Manager is installed and configured on the SharePoint server farm.
