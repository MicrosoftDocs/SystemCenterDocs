# Getting Started

Welcome to the Getting Started documentation for Operations Manager, a component of System Center 2016.

Operations Manager enables you to monitor the applications, networks devices, systems and other components supporting your IT services.  Operators can gain rapid insight into the state of the environments and IT services running across different systems and workloads by delivering dashboards displaying their health and performance, through alerts generated, performance data, configuration details, and security issues.
