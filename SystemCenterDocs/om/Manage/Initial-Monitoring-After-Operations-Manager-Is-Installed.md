#Initial Monitoring After Operations Manager Is Installed

When Operations Manager is first installed, only the features of the Operations Manager infrastructure such as management servers, reporting servers, and databases are monitored. Monitoring of the roles and core functionality of the management group is provided by a number of management packs that are included when you create the management group, such as the System Center Core Monitoring and System Center Operations Manager Infrastructure Monitoring management packs.  

After Operations Manager is installed, you must decide which IT service you should start to monitor and identify the objects to monitor, meaning the systems, application components and transactions, and other infrastructure elements hosted on premise and in the cloud.

- [Using Management Packs](Using-Management-Packs.md)

    Monitoring for applications, features, and services is enabled by importing management packs. This section from the System Center 2016 section of the TechNet library explains what management packs do, and how to import and manage them.
