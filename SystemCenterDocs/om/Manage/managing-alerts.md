# Managing Alerts

An alert is an indication of a significant event requiring attention. Rules and monitors can generate alerts. You can view alerts in the **Monitoring** workspace of the Operations console or Web console.  This section includes guidance on how to review, manage, and improve accuracy of the IT services monitored by Operations Manager.
