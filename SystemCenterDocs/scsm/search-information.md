# Search for information in Service Manager


In Service Manager, you can use the search feature in the Service Manager console to look for information. The search box is in the upper\-right corner of the Service Manager console. By default, the search feature looks for all objects. The results can include incidents, change requests, problems, and configuration items of Windows\-based computers. You can filter search results by using the filter bar. You can also perform an advanced search for these items plus the following items:  

- Knowledge articles  

- Domain users  

- Manual activities  

However, only knowledge articles are returned when you perform a knowledge search.  

When you search for most items in Service Manager, only exact keyword matches return results. However, partial matches are returned for configuration items of Windows\-based computers. Searches that use wildcard characters aren't supported.  

When you search for items, you open a view that displays a large number of items, and there are more than 5,000 items in the results, the complete results can take a few minutes to appear.
