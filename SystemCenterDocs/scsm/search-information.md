# Search for information in Service Manager

>Applies To: System Center 2016 - Service Manager

In Service Manager, you can use the search feature in the Service Manager console to look for information. The search box is in the upper\-right corner of the Service Manager console. By default, the search feature looks for all objects. The results can include incidents, change requests, problems, and configuration items of Windows\-based computers. You can filter search results by using the filter bar. You can also perform an advanced search for these items plus the following items:  

-   Knowledge articles  

-   Domain users  

-   Manual activities  

 However, only knowledge articles are returned when you perform a knowledge search.  

 When you search for most items in Service Manager, only exact keyword matches return results. However, partial matches are returned for configuration items of Windows\-based computers. Searches that use wildcard characters are not supported.  

 When you search for items, you open a view that displays a large number of items, and there are more than 5,000 items in the results, the complete results can take a few minutes to appear.
