This article provides an overview of how to use the service catalog in Service Manager. This article also contains procedures that cover management configuration scenarios for the service catalog.

The service catalog is a collection of items, assistance, actions, or groupings of them that your IT staff and infrastructure provides and makes available to end-users in the Self-Service Portal in Service Manager. In the Service Manager console, you create catalog items to describe these items in the Library workspace using the following nodes:

-   Request Offerings

-   Service Offerings

The Request Offerings node is used to create a catalog item that describes an item, assistance, or action that is available to end-users. It also defines information that you want to prompt the users for and any knowledge articles that are associated with the offering.

After it's created, you can set the status of a request offering as either Draft or Published. Draft status indicates that a request offering isn't published and available to the service catalog. This prevents end-users from requesting the offering. When you set the request offering status to Published, it appears in the catalog where users can request it if they've been granted access to a catalog item group that contains the request offering.

The Service Offerings node is used to create a catalog item that categorizes request offerings.

## Create your own service offering categories

By default, Service Manager includes only the General service offering category. However, your organization will likely need additional categories to help organize service offerings that are provided to end-users through the service catalog. You can use the following procedure to add additional categories to the service catalog.

### To extend the service offering categories

1.  In the Service Manager console, select **Library**.
2.  In the **Library** pane, select **Lists**, and then in the **Filter** box, enter **offering**.
3.  In the **Lists** view, select **Service Offering Category**, and then in the **Tasks** list under **Service Offering Category**, select **Properties**.
4.  In the **List Properties** dialog, add any service offering categories that you want, and select **OK** to close the dialog. For example, add the following categories:
    -   **Data Center**
    -   **Access and Security**
    -   **Communication Services**
5.  Select **OK** to close the **List Properties** dialog.

## Create a service offering

Service offerings are logical groups of request offerings. Both service offerings and their request offerings are available to Self-Service Portal users when their status is set to Published and if end-users have been assigned a corresponding Service Manager user role. Only users who have been assigned a user role that is associated with a catalog group that contains catalog items can use the Self-Service Portal to access the service catalog.

### To create a service offering

1.  In the Service Manager console, select **Library**.
2.  In the **Library** pane, expand **Service Catalog**, and then select **Service Offerings**.
3.  In the **Tasks** pane under **Service Offerings**, select **Create Service Offering** to open the Create Service Offering Wizard.
4.  On the **Before You Begin** page, read the instructions, and select **Next**.

    1.  In the **Title** box, enter a title for the service offering. For example, enter **Access Services**.
    2.  Optionally, next to **Image**, you can either **Browse** to an image file or leave the default selection.
    3.  In the **Category** list, select a category that this service offering will be a part of. For example, select **Access and Security**.
    4.  In the **Language** list, either leave the default selection or select a language.
    5.  In the **Overview** text box, enter a short overview to describe the service offering that will be shown on the Self-Service Portal home page. For example, enter **Access to AD Group, Access to Labs**.
    6.  In the description box, enter a description that will appear on the service offering page in the Self-Service Portal.
    7.  Next to the **Management pack**, select an unsealed management pack of your choice, and select **Next**. For example, if you previously created the Sample Management Pack, select it.

    2.  In the first **Link for additional information** box, enter a hyperlink that users can select to view additional information about the SLA for this service offering.
    3.  In the **Cost information** box, enter a summary of any costs associated with requests that will be grouped in this service offering.
    4.  In the second **Link for additional information** box, enter a hyperlink that users can select to view additional information about any costs associated with requests that will be grouped in this service offering.
    5.  Select **Next**.

## Create service request templates for new request offerings

By default, Service Manager includes a number of service request templates that are based on a generic incident template. By viewing the template, you can gain an understanding of the categories of information to collect and convey to end-users as they submit requests through the Self-Service Portal. You can use the following procedure to create a new service request template without using the default generic incident request template.

If you want to publish the request offering as part of a category, you must add the request offering to a service offering.

If you want to have an approval process added before publishing, you can associate the request offering to a change request. If you use a change request, you can also send email notifications as the approval process occurs.

> [!NOTE]
> Various errors might occur if you create a request offering without mapped prompts or if you've erroneously mapped any prompts. The errors can occur after you associate a change request to the request offering and then you complete the change request. To avoid such errors, ensure that you've at least one prompt in the request offering and that all the prompts are mapped correctly.
