This article provides information about how to determine your current Microsoft System Center – Service Manager version number and the corresponding update rollup. Each update rollup (UR) release has a link to a support article describing the UR changes and links to the package downloads.

> [!NOTE]
> All System Center Service Manager update rollups are cumulative. This means, you don't need to apply the URs in order; you can always apply the latest update. If you've deployed System Center – Service Manager and never applied an update rollup, you can proceed to install the latest one available.
