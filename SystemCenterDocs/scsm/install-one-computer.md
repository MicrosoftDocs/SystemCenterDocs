# Install Service Manager on a single computer (minimum configuration)

If you want to evaluate System Center - Service Manager and you've a minimal amount of hardware available, install Service Manager on one computer. A sample single-computer configuration is shown in figure&nbsp;1. This configuration won't support a production environment, and no scalability or performance estimates are provided. Because you can't install both the Service Manager management server and the data warehouse management server on the same computer, use Hyper-V to create a virtual computer to host the data warehouse management server.

 To install Service Manager on a single computer, start with a physical computer that is running Windows Server and Hyper-V, and ensure that the CPU on the physical computer is compatible with Hyper-V. Of the 8&nbsp;gigabytes (GB) of RAM on the host computer, 3&nbsp;GB is used for the virtual computer that hosts the data warehouse management server. Ensure that at least 200&nbsp;GB of free space is available on the hard disk drive.  

 **Figure 1: Single-computer installation in which you use a physical computer that is running Windows Server and Hyper-V**  

 ![Screenshot showing the Minimum Configuration for Service Manager.](./media/install-one-computer/deploy-minimumconfiguration.png)  

 If your organization's best practice guidelines don't allow you to install applications on a Hyper-V host, you can create a second virtual computer to host the Service Manager management server, the Service Manager database, and the data warehouse databases. Use the following procedures to install Service Manager on a single computer.  

## Install Service Manager

To install System Center - Service Manager on a single computer, you install the Service Manager management server, database, and console on the computer. Then, you install the data warehouse on a virtual machine on the same computer.  

 During Setup, you'll be prompted to provide credentials for the following accounts:  

- Management group administrator  

- Service Manager account  

- Workflow account  

For more information about the permissions that these accounts require, see **Accounts Required During Setup** in the [Planning Guide for System Center - Service Manager](plan-sm.md). Before you start, ensure that Microsoft SQL&nbsp;Server is installed on the computer.  

### Install the Service Manager management server, database, and console  

1. Sign in to the physical computer by using an account that has administrative credentials.  

2. On the Service Manager installation media, double\-click the **Setup.exe** file.  

3. On the **Microsoft System Center \<version\>** page, select **Service Manager management server**.  

4. On the **Product registration** page, enter information in the boxes. In the **Product key** boxes, enter the product key that you received with Service Manager, or alternatively, select **Install as an evaluation edition \(180 day trial\)**. Read the Microsoft Software License Terms, and, if applicable, select **I have read, understood, and agree with the terms of the license agreement**, and select **Next**.  

5. On the **Installation location** page, verify that sufficient free disk space is available, and select **Next**. If necessary, select **Browse** to change the location in which the Service Manager management server will be installed.  

6. On the **System check results** page, ensure that the prerequisite check passed or at least passed with warnings, and select **Next**.  

    If the prerequisite checker determines that the Microsoft Report Viewer Redistributable hasn't been installed, select **Install Microsoft Report Viewer Redistributable**. After the Microsoft Report Viewer Redistributable 2008 \(KB971119\) Setup Wizard completes, select **Check prerequisites again**.  

7. On the **Configure the Service Manager database** page, Service Manager checks the current computer to see if an instance of SQL&nbsp;Server exists. By default, if an instance is found, Service Manager creates a new database in the existing instance. If an instance is displayed, select **Next**.  

   > [!IMPORTANT]  
   > A warning message appears if you're using the default collation \(SQL\_Latin1\_General\_CP1\_CI\_AS\). Support for multiple languages in Service Manager isn't possible when you're using the default collation. If later you decide to support multiple languages using a different collation, you've to reinstall SQL&nbsp;Server. See [Planning Guide for System Center - Service Manager](plan-sm.md).  

8. On the **Configure the Service Manager management group** page, complete these steps:  

   1. In the **Management group name** box, enter a unique name for the management group.  

       > [!IMPORTANT]  
       > Management group names must be unique. Don't use the same management group name when you deploy a Service Manager management server and a Service Manager data warehouse management server. Furthermore, don't use the management group name that is used for Operations Manager.  

   2. Select **Browse**, enter the user account or group to which you want to give Service Manager administrative credentials, and select **Next**.  

9. On the **Configure the account for Service Manager services** page, select **Domain account**; specify the user name, password, and domain for the account; and select **Test Credentials**. After you receive a **The credentials were accepted** message, select **Next**.
