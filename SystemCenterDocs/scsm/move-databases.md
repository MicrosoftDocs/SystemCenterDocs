After you have deployed Service Manager, you might need to move the Service Manager or data warehouse databases from one computer running Microsoft SQL Server to another for reasons such as the following:  

- You need to replace hardware that is experiencing issues and that is no longer considered reliable.  

- You need to add additional hardware to improve scalability and performance.  

- You need to move a database and log file to a different volume because of space or performance reasons.  

- You need to change hardware that is leased and is due to expire soon.  

- You need to change or upgrade hardware to comply with new hardware standards.  

- You initially installed multiple Service Manager components on a single server, and you need to distribute some components to other servers.  

- You need to restore functionality in a failure scenario.  

If you want the move the data warehouse database, and if you have installed Service Manager within the last 90 days, it might be easier for you to unregister the data warehouse, install a new data warehouse, and register the new database. If the data has not been groomed from the Service Manager database, there will be no data loss in the data warehouse database because it will be synchronized. By default, the grooming interval for work items is 90 days from the last time a work item was modified. Using this process is much simpler than using the following guidance, which details how to move your databases from one server to another and requires many steps.  


## Move the Service Manager database

You must use the following high\-level steps to move the Service Manager database.  

> [!NOTE]  
>  These steps link to content in the Service Manager Upgrade Guide.  

1.  Open the inbound SQL Port on new Service Manager database server. The default port is 1433.  

2.  Stop the System Center services on all the management servers.  

3.  Back up the Service Manager database, as described in [How to Back Up the Production Service Manager Database](prod-env.md#back-up-the-production-service-manager-database-for-future-recovery).  

4.  Restore the Service Manager database on the target computer that is running Microsoft SQL Server, as described in [How to Restore the Service Manager Database in the Lab Environment](lab-env.md#restore-the-service-manager-database-in-the-lab-environment).  

5.  Configure the Service Manager database, as described in [How to Prepare the Service Manager Database in the Lab Environment](lab-env.md#prepare-the-service-manager-database-in-the-lab-environment).  

    > [!IMPORTANT]  
    >  Do not perform step 17 in the procedure for configuring tables.  

6.  After you move the ServiceManager database, ensure that you manually change all the Service Manager database and data warehouse registration information in the DWStagingAndConfig database. Old information about where the ServiceManager database is located remains in the DWStagingAndConfig database in the following tables:  

    -   MT\_Microsoft$Systemcenter$Datawarehouse$CMDBSource  

        -   In the corresponding entry with DataSourceName\_GUID \= \<Service Manager Data Source Name\>, change the field DatabaseServer\_GUID with the new name of the SQLServer\\Instance where the ServiceManager database has moved to.  

    -   MT\_Microsoft$Systemcenter$ResourceAccessLayer$SqlResourceStore  

        -   In the corresponding entry with DataService\_GUID \= ServiceManager, change the field Server\_GUID to the new name of the SQLServer\\Instance where the ServiceManager database has moved to.  

7.  Configure the registry on all the management servers that will access the new SQL Server instance, by using the following steps:  

    1.  Open Registry Editor.  

    2.  Browse to **HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\\Software\\Microsoft\\System Center\\\<version\>\\Common\\Database**.  

    3.  Configure two keys: one for the server name \(DatabaseServerName\) and one for the database name \(DatabaseName\). Set values to the new server name and database name, if they are different from the original values.  

8.  If you are also upgrading the SQL server while moving, then upgrade the following SQL Server prerequisites for the Service Manager Management server. There are 2 SQL Server prerequisites:  

    -   SQL Native Client  

    -   Analysis Management Objects \(AMO\)  

9. Start the System Center services on all the management servers, as described in [How to Start Service Manager Services on the Secondary Management Server](lab-env.md#start-service-manager-services-on-the-secondary-management-server).  

10. Install another Service Manager database that has a different name on the same computer that is running SQL Server, by installing another Service Manager management server and choosing to create a new database. This step will populate the master database with error message text so that if an error occurs in the future, the error message can describe the specific problem instead of displaying generic text. After the database is installed, you can drop it from the computer that is running SQL Server and uninstall the additional, temporary management server.  

     \-Or\-  

     Run the following query on the source Service Manager database server and copy the output script and then run it on new Service Manager database server.  

    ```  
    DECLARE @crlf char(2);  
    DECLARE @tab char(1);  
    SET @crlf = CHAR(13) + CHAR(10);  
    SET @tab = CHAR(9);  

    SELECT   
           'EXEC sp_addmessage ' + @crlf + @tab  
            + '@msgnum = ' + CAST(m.message_id AS varchar(30))  
                  + ', ' + @crlf + @tab  
          + '@severity = ' + CAST(m.severity AS varchar(3))    
                  + ', ' + @crlf + @tab  
          + '@msgtext = N''' + REPLACE(m.[text],'''','''''')    
                  + ''''  + ', ' + @crlf + @tab  
            + '@lang = ''' +   
                  (SELECT TOP 1 alias   
                   FROM master.sys.syslanguages l   
                   WHERE l.lcid = m.language_id)   
                   + ''', ' + @crlf + @tab  
          + '@with_log = ''' +   
                  CASE WHEN m.is_event_logged = 1   
                   THEN 'TRUE' ELSE 'FALSE' END   + ''', ' +  @crlf + @tab  
                  -- Uncomment ONLY if you want to replace:  
            + '@replace = ''replace'';'   
            + @crlf + 'GO' + @crlf + @crlf   
    FROM   
            master.sys.messages m  
    WHERE   
           m.message_id > 50000;  

    GO  
    ```  

## Move data warehouse databases

The following high\-level steps are required to move the data warehouse databases. Each step in this list links to an associated procedure later in this document.  

1. Locate user accounts and instances of SQL Server
2. Stop Service Manager services
3. Back up the data warehouse databases
4. Take the data warehouse databases offline
5. Restore the data warehouse databases on the new computer running SQL Server
6. Prepare the data warehouse databases on the new database server
7. Update data warehouse management Server with the new database server name
