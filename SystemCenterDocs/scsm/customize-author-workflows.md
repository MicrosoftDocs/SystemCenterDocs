# Workflows - Customizing and Authoring

>Applies To: System Center 2016 - Service Manager

Using Service Manager, you can automate many administrative processes that previously required manual tasks. The feature that makes this automation possible is the Windows Workflow Foundation \(WF\) workflow. A WF workflow comprises workflow activities, which are also referred to as *WF activities* to differentiate them from other Service Manager activity types. Each workflow activity performs a function, such as joining a user or a computer to a group in Active Directory Domain Services \(AD&nbsp;DS\), creating a Service Manager incident, or running a script. You can assemble WF activities into a workflow that performs a set of tasks, and you can specify the conditions under which the workflow runs.
