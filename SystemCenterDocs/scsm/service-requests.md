# Manage service requests in Service Manager



Service requests are requests for existing, preauthorized services and features that Service Manager can manage as a type of work item. Service requests help you deliver a service request fulfillment solution to align your business and information technology (IT) strategy and ensure that IT services provide business value. Service requests are tightly coupled with the service catalog, and together they help add value to your IT organization by clearly managing service requests. This can help lead to a better understanding of the supply and demand for services and a more efficient and transparent customer service provided by your IT organization.  

 Service request functionality in Service Manager is based on Microsoft Operations Framework (MOF)&nbsp;4.0 and Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL)&nbsp;V3 processes in order to align with industry standards. While not all functionality was completed with strict adherence to those standards, the following items are included in service request fulfillment in Service Manager:  

-   Processes to record, track, and process service requests  

-   Service fulfillment workflow automation  

-   A consistent interface that helps Service Manager administrators identify and map their existing IT services  

-   Support for situations where cost tracking and service level agreements (SLAs) are required  

-   Time-to-resolution tracking through SLA integration  

## Create a service request using the Service Manager console

End-users often create service requests in Service Manager by accessing the service catalog from the Self-Service Portal or by submitting email requests. However, you can use the following procedure to manually create a new service request in the Service Manager console. For example, you might want to manually create a new service request if a user contacts the help desk by telephone. In the following example, you can update any information that you want to as you complete the form.  

### To create a new service request using the Service Manager console  

1.  In the Service Manager console, expand **Work Items**, expand **Service Request Fulfillment**, and then select a subnode, such as **Assigned To Me**.  

2.  In the **Tasks** pane under **Service Request Fulfillment**, select **Create Service Request from Template**.  

3.  Under **Templates** in the **Select Template** dialog, select a template, and select **OK** to open a new service request and apply the template. For example, select **Request Membership to Group**.  

4.  In the **&lt;SR&lt;ID&gt;: ServiceRequestName&gt;** form in the **Affected user** box, select the user who submitted the service request. For example, select **Joe Andreshak**.  

5.  Optionally, in the **Alternate Contact Method** box, enter additional contact information for the affected user.  

6.  In the **Title** box, enter a title for the service request or update one if it has been populated by a template. For example, enter **Request Membership to Active Directory Group - Joe Andreshak**.
