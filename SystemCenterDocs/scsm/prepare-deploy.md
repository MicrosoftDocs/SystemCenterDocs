::: moniker-end

Before you start the deployment of System Center - Service Manager, you create a group of users in Active Directory Domain Services \(AD DS\), and you create or identify a domain account that will be used during the Setup process. Make sure that the domain account is a member of the appropriate groups that are necessary for proper operation of Service Manager. Keep the following in mind when you are installing Service Manager and Operations Manager on the same server:  

- Operations Manager can share the database server with Service Manager.  

- An Operations Manager agent is automatically installed as part of Service Manager. After Setup completes, you must manually configure the agent for use with the Operations Manager management server.

     To validate that the Operations Manager Agent was installed, open Control Panel and verify that the Operations Manager Agent is present.

-   You can install both the Operations Manager console and the Service Manager console on the same computer. The order in which you install the consoles does not matter.  

-   Do not attempt to use the same SQL Server Reporting Services \(SSRS\) instance for both Operations Manager and Service Manager.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you install System Center 2019 Service Manager with SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) 2017, Service Manager reports don't deploy, an event 33410 occurs and displays the details for the deployment failure. See the following information for the cause and resolution for this issue.  

SSRS 2017 version 14.0.600.1274 and later includes a new advanced setting *AllowedResourceExtensionsForUpload*. This setting restricts the set of extensions of resource files that can be uploaded to the reporting server. This issue occurs because Service Manager reporting uses extensions that aren't included in the default set in *AllowedResourceExtensionsForUpload*.

To resolve this issue, add \*.\* to the list of extensions. Follow these steps:

1. Start SQL Server Management Studio, and then connect to a report server instance that Service Manager uses.
2. Right-click the report server name, select **Properties**, and then select **Advanced**.
3. Locate the **AllowedResourceExtensionsForUpload** setting, add \*.\* to the list of extensions, and then select **OK**.
4. Restart SSRS.

### Accounts required when you install Service Manager

You will have to provide credentials for the accounts in the following table during the installation of the Service Manager and data warehouse management servers.  

> [!NOTE]  
>The user accounts and group accounts that are required for the installation of Service Manager must reside in the Users organizational unit \(OU\) in Active Directory Domain Services \(AD DS\).  

#### Accounts used when installing a Service Manager management server  

|Account|Permissions|How it is used in Service Manager|  
|-------------|-----------------|---------------------------------------------|

### Credential used when registering a Service Manager management group with the data warehouse management group

 As part of the installation process, you register the Service Manager management group with the data warehouse management group. During this process, you will be prompted to provide credentials. The account credentials that you provide must be a domain account. Furthermore, you will have to provide an account with the following permissions:  

-   Must be a member of the Administrator user role in both the Service Manager and data warehouse management groups.  
-   Must be a member of the users local administrator group on the data warehouse management server.  

### Accounts required to create connectors

 When you are creating connectors, you are asked for credentials that the connector will use to perform its function. The following outlines the permissions that this account will need, and it describes best practices for high security.  

 Connector accounts for Operations Manager, Orchestrator, SCVMM, AD requires **Log on as a service**.

 To set these permissions, use **Security Settings** > **Local Policies** > **User Rights Assignment** .

**Optional**:
 - Deny log on as a batch job
 - Deny log on through Remote Desktop Services.

## Prepare computers for Service Manager deployment


Use the following procedures to prepare computers for deployment of Service Manager.  

### To prepare computers for Service Manager deployment  

1. Make sure that no Operations Manager parts are installed on the computers that will host either Service Manager or the data warehouse.  
2. Create an Active Directory group of users that will be assigned to the role of Service Manager administrators of both the data warehouse and Service Manager management groups. For example, create the group **SM\_Admins**.  

   > [!NOTE]  
   >  This group of users must be in the same domain that Service Manager is in. Users from any other domain-even child domains-are not supported.  

3. Create the accounts that are necessary for Service Manager.

   > [!NOTE]  
   >  Service Manager accounts must be in the same domain that Service Manager is in. Accounts from any other domain-even child domains-are not supported.  

4. Make sure that the Structured Query Language \(SQL\) instances that are used for Service Manager databases are using port number 1433.
5. If you are installing the databases on a remote computer running Microsoft SQL Server, the user who is running Setup must be a domain user with local administrator permissions on the SQL Server computer.  
6. On computers that will host the Service Manager console, under **Internet Options**, **Local Area Network \(LAN\) Settings**, select **Bypass proxy server for local addresses**.  

7. Open a browser, and then enter the following two URLs:  

   - `http://<computer hosting SSRS>/reports`  

   - `http://<computer hosting SSRS>/reportserver`  

     If either connection attempt fails or returns an error-for example, **HTTP Error 404.0 Not Found**-complete the steps in the procedure "To configure the reporting server." Otherwise, continue with the installation of Service Manager.  

### To configure the reporting server  

1.  By using an account that has administrator rights, log on to the computer that will host SQL Server Reporting Services \(SSRS\).  

2.  Click **Start**, point to **Programs**, point to **Microsoft SQL Server 2008**, point to **Configuration Tools**, and then click **Reporting Services Configuration Manager**.  

3.  In the **Reporting Services Configuration Connection** dialog box, make sure that the information in **Server Name** and **Report Server Instance** is correct, and then click **Connect**.  

4.  In the **Connect** pane, click **Web Service URL**.  

5.  In the **Report Server Web Service Virtual Directory** area, in the **Virtual Directory** text box, make sure that the entry is **ReportServer**, and then click **Apply**.  

6.  In the **Connect** pane, click **Report Manager URL**.  

7.  In the **Report Manager Site Identification** area, in the **Virtual Directory** text box, make sure that the entry reads **Reports**, and then click **Apply**.  

8.  In the **Connect** pane, click the top entry (`<server>\\<instance>`).  

9. In the **Current Report Server** area, click **Stop**, and then click **Start**.
