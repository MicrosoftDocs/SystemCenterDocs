## Restart data warehouse jobs

 After you upgrade the data warehouse management server, you might need to restart the data warehouse (extraction, transformation, and load (ETL)) jobs. You can use the following procedure to restart the data warehouse jobs. In this procedure, you enable data warehouse job schedules by using Windows PowerShell cmdlets.  

#### Restart data warehouse jobs  

Follow these steps to restart data warehouse jobs:

1.  On the computer that hosts the data warehouse management server, select **Start**, point to **Programs**, point to **Accessories**, select **Windows PowerShell**, right-click **Windows PowerShell**, and select **Run as administrator**.  

2.  Enter the following commands and then press Enter after each command.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  It's assumed in the following command examples that Service Manager was installed in its default location on the C: drive. If necessary, change directories to the location where you installed Service Manager.

    ```  
    cd 'C:\Program Files\Microsoft System Center <version>\Service Manager'  
    ```  

    ```  
    import-module $PWD/Microsoft.EnterpriseManagement.Warehouse.Cmdlets.psd1  
    ```  

    ```  
    Get-SCDWJob  
    ```  

    ```  
    Enable-SCDWJobSchedule -JobName Extract_<data warehouse management group name>  
    ```  

    ```  
    Enable-SCDWJobSchedule -JobName Extract_<Service Manager management group name>  
    ```  

    ```  
    Enable-SCDWJobSchedule -JobName Transform.Common  
    ```  

    ```  
    Enable-SCDWJobSchedule -JobName Load.Common  
    ```  

    ```  
    Enable-SCDWJobSchedule -JobName DWMaintenance  
    ```  

    ```  
    Enable-SCDWJobSchedule -JobName MPSyncJob  
    ```  

    ```  
    Start-SCDWJob -JobName MPSyncJob  
    ```  

     The last command, **Start\-SCDWJob - JobName MPSyncJob**, will enable the ETL jobs to run.  

## Stop and then restart SSRS  
 After you perform an upgrade, use the following procedure to stop and then start SSRS.  

#### Stop and then restart SSRS

Follow these steps to stop and then restart SSRS:

2.  In the **Run** dialog, enter **services.msc**, and select **OK**.  

3.  In the **Services** window, in the **Services (Local)** pane, right-click **SQL Server Reporting Services**, and select **Stop**.
