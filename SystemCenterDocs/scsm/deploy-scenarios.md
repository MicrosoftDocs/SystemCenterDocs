# Deployment scenarios for System Center - Service Manager

System Center - Service Manager provides for many deployment scenarios. However, you can't deploy a Service Manager management server and a data warehouse management server on the same computer. In fact, Setup prevents you from installing both on a single server. The reason has to do with Service Manager architecture of the data warehouse, overall performance, and usage of the Operations Manager health service. The data warehouse was designed for quick data retrieval and hosting both the Service Manager management server and the data warehouse management server on a single server will negatively impact performance for both. Additionally, a single server doesn't scale out as Service Manager usage and data storage grow.  

 You will also specify the server that hosts SQL&nbsp;Server Reporting Services \(SSRS\). Don't attempt to use the same SSRS instance for both Operations Manager and Service Manager.  

 >[!NOTE]
 > We recommend English as the default language for the SQL users' sign in accounts.
 >
 > As date format is based on the language, if the language of SQL user sign in accounts isn't English, then a few data warehouse jobs, especially the jobs that use SQL *SET_DateFormat* function, fail. These jobs don't push the data into the data warehouse from Service Manager or might send incorrect data into the data warehouse, leading to data corruption in the data warehouse.
>
>You can set the default language as English for a new SQL sign in account or change the default language for an existing account. [Learn more](deploy-sm.md#manage-default-language-for-sql-login-accounts).

## Deployment scenarios

The deployment guide describes the following three deployment scenarios: [installing Service Manager on one computer](install-one-computer.md), [installing Service Manager on two computers](install-two-computers.md), and [installing Service Manager on four computers](install-four-computers.md).  

> [!NOTE]  
> The collation settings for Microsoft SQL&nbsp;Server must be the same for the computers that host the Service Manager database, the computers that host the data warehouse databases, and the computers that host the Reporting Services database. If you intend to import data from Operations Manager, then the database collations must match between Service Manager and Operations Manager.  

 While we don't recommend it \(for performance reasons\), if you want to host the Service Manager management server and the Self-Service Portal on the same computer, you must deploy the Service Manager management server before you deploy the Self-Service Portal.  

 Performing an upgrade from technical preview versions of Service Manager isn't supported. Furthermore, for this release, Service Manager setup installs files in predefined folders that might already exist if you've a previous version of Service Manager installed.  

 The user installing Service Manager has access to the Service Connection Point \(SCP\) object of Service Manager in the Active Directory. This SCP stores the information about the service. Client applications, such as Service Manager, can connect to services using the SCP. For more information about service connection points, see [Publishing Services in Active Directory](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-2000-server/cc961733(v=technet.10)).  

## Next steps

- To install Service Manager on a single computer, review [Install on a single computer (minimum configuration)](install-one-computer.md). This scenario requires you to use a virtual machine for the data warehouse management server. This scenario is useful for evaluation purposes.
