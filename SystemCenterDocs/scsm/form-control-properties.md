# Form control properties in the Service Manager Authoring Tool

The table in this topic lists the properties of Service Manager form controls. This information can help you customize and create forms in the Service Manager Authoring Tool.  

 Most properties of Service Manager forms are based on Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) properties, and other properties are defined by Service Manager. The following table provides details about the WPF-based property groups and their respective properties, when they are applicable. For more information about WPF properties, see [System.Windows.Controls Namespace](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=204425) on MSDN.
