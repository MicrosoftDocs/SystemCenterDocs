Use the following procedures to prepare for Service Manager upgrade by creating a lab environment and preparing it for production data for the purpose of upgrade testing.

Many of the procedures in this article are lengthy and might take a considerable amount of time to complete. As long as you complete the procedures in order, you don't need to complete them without stopping.


## Restore the Service Manager database in the lab environment

Use the following procedure to restore the production Service Manager database using Microsoft&nbsp;SQL&nbsp;Server&nbsp;2016.  


1. After connecting to the appropriate instance of the Microsoft SQL Server Database Engine, in Object Explorer, select the server name to expand the server tree.  
2. Expand **Databases**, and depending on the database, either select a user database or expand **System Databases** and select a system database.  
3. Right-click the database, point to **Tasks**, and select **Restore**. The Back Up Database dialog appears.  
4. Select **Database**, which opens the **Restore Database** dialog.  
5. On the **General** page, the name of the restoring database appears in the **To database** list box. To create a new database, enter its name in the list box.  
6. In the **To a point in time** text box, either retain the default \(Most recent possible\) or select a specific date and time by selecting the browse button, which opens the **Point in Time Restore** dialog. For more information, see [How to: Restore to a Point in Time \(SQL Server Management Studio\)](/sql/relational-databases/backup-restore/restore-a-sql-server-database-to-a-point-in-time-full-recovery-model).  
7. To specify the source and location of the backup sets to restore, select either **From database** or **From device**.  
8. In the **Select the backup sets to restore** grid, select the backups to restore. For more information, see [Restore Database \(General Page\)](/sql/relational-databases/backup-restore/restore-database-general-page).  
9. To view or select the advanced options, select **Options** in the **Select a page pane**.  
10. In the **Restore options** panel, choose one of the following options most appropriate for your situation:  
    - Overwrite the existing database  
    - Preserve the replication settings  
    - Prompt before restoring each backup  
    - Restrict access to the restored database  

      For more information, see [Restore Database \(Options Page\)](/sql/relational-databases/backup-restore/restore-database-options-page)  
11. Optionally, you can restore the database to a new location by specifying a new restore destination for each file in **Restore the database files as**. For more information, see [Restore Database \(Options Page\)](/sql/relational-databases/backup-restore/restore-database-options-page).  
12. In the **Recovery state** panel, select one of the following options most appropriate for your environment:  
    - **Leave the database ready to use by rolling back the uncommitted transactions. Additional transaction logs cannot be restored. \(RESTORE WITH RECOVERY\)**  

      > [!NOTE]  
      > Choose this option only if you're restoring all of the necessary backups at this time.  

    - **Leave the database non\-operational, and do not roll back the uncommitted transactions. Additional transaction logs can be restored. \(RESTORE WITH NORECOVERY\)**  
    - **Leave the database in read\-only mode. Undo uncommitted transactions, but save the undo actions in a standby file so that recovery effects can be reverted. \(RESTORE WITH STANDBY\)**  

      For more information, see [Restore Database \(Options Page\)](/sql/relational-databases/backup-restore/restore-database-options-page).

2. In the Service Manager console, select **Administration**.  
3. In the **Administration** pane, expand **Administration**.  
4. In the **Administration** view, in the **Register with Service Manager's Data Warehouse** area, select **Register with Service Manager Data Warehouse**.  
5. In the Data Warehouse Registration wizard, on the **Before You Begin** page, select **Next**.  
6. On the **Data Warehouse** page, in the **Server name** box, enter the fully qualified domain name of the computer hosting the data warehouse management server, and select **Test Connection**. If the test is successful, select **Next**.  
7. On the **Credentials** page, you can accept the default entry in the **Run as account** list, and select **Next**, or you can enter credentials from a user or group of your own choosing.  

   > [!IMPORTANT]  
   >  The account you specify will be assigned administrative credentials on the Service Manager management server and granted Read permission on the Service Manager database. You can specify different credentials from other Service Manager management groups when registering with the data warehouse.  

8. On the **Summary** page, select **Create**.  
9. On the **Completion** page, when **The data warehouse registration succeeded** is displayed, select **Close**.  
10. A dialog states that the report deployment process hasn't finished. This is to be expected. On the **System Center Service Manager** dialog, select **OK**.  
11. In a few minutes, after closing the Data Warehouse Registration wizard, the **Data Warehouse** button will be added to the Service Manager console. In the Service Manager console, select the arrow at the lower right corner of the Service Manager console buttons, and select **Show More Buttons**.  

    You can use a Windows PowerShell command to complete this task. For information about how to use Windows PowerShell to register Service Manager management groups with the data warehouse, see [Add\-SCDWMgmtGroup](/previous-versions/system-center/service-manager-2010-sp1/ff951619(v=technet.10)).  

### Validate the registration

1.  On the computer hosting the data warehouse management server, start Windows PowerShell with administrative credentials.  
2.  At the Windows PowerShell command prompt, enter the following commands, and then press ENTER:  

    ```  
    Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned  
    Import-Module .\Microsoft.EnterpriseManagement.Warehouse.Cmdlets.psd1  

    ```  

3.  Enter the following command, and then press ENTER.  

    ```  
    Get-SCDWMgmtGroup  

    ```  

4.  If the registration is successful, a table with two rows of data is displayed. One row displays data for the data warehouse management group, and a second row displays data for the Service Manager management group. If the registration fails, only the data for the data warehouse management group is displayed.  

### Determine when the deployment is complete  
 Because you need to allow enough time for the management pack deployment process to be completed, you'll have to determine when that process is complete. You can use the following procedure in Service Manager to determine when the process is complete.  

#### To determine when management pack deployment has completed  

1.  Start the Service Manager console.  
2.  In the Service Manager console, select **Data Warehouse**.  
3.  In the **Data Warehouse** pane, expand **Data Warehouse**, and select **Data Warehouse Jobs**.  
4.  In the **Data Warehouse Jobs** pane, select **MPSyncJob**.  
5.  In the **Tasks** pane, under **Synchronization**, select **Details**.  
6.  In the **MP Sync Job** dialog, scroll to the right and examine the **Status** column.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  In the **MP Sync Job** dialog, select **Status** to alphabetically sort the status column.  

7.  Scroll through the **Status** list. The management pack deployment process is complete when **Associated** or **Imported** is listed in the status column for all of the management packs. Ensure that there's no status of either **Pending Association** or **Failed** in the status list. In the **Data Warehouse Jobs** pane, the status of the **MPSyncJob** will have changed from **Running** to **Not Started**. This deployment process can take up to two hours to complete.  
8.  To refresh the **MP Sync Job** dialog:  
    1.  Press **OK** to close the dialog.  
    2.  In the **Tasks** pane, in the **Data Warehouse Jobs** area, select **Refresh**.  
    3.  In the **Data Warehouse Jobs** pane, select **MPSyncJobs**.  
    4.  In the **Tasks** pane, under **Synchronization**, select **Details**.  
9. After the management packs have been deployed \(as determined in step 7\), ensure that the following five data warehouse jobs are displayed in the **Data Warehouse Jobs** pane:  

    -   Extract\_\<Service Manager management group name\>  
    -   Extract\_\<data warehouse management group name\>  
    -   Load.Common  
    -   Transform.Common  
    -   MPSyncJob  

10. If these five data warehouse jobs aren't displayed, perform the following procedure:  
    1.  In the **Data Warehouse Jobs** pane, select **MPSyncJob**.  
    2.  In the **Tasks** pane, under **Synchronization**, select **Resume**.  
    3.  Assess if management pack deployment has completed by returning to step 4 above.
