3.  Type the following command, and then press ENTER.  

    ```  
    Get-SCDWMgmtGroup  

    ```  

4.  If registration was successful, a table with two rows of data is displayed. One row displays data for the data warehouse management group, and a second row displays data for the Service Manager management group. If registration fails, only the data for the data warehouse management group is displayed.  

### Determine when the deployment is complete  
 Because you need to allow enough time for the management pack deployment process to be completed, you will have to determine when that process is complete. You can use the following procedure in Service Manager to determine when the process is complete.  

#### To determine when management pack deployment has completed  

1.  Start the Service Manager console.  
2.  In the Service Manager console, click **Data Warehouse**.  
3.  In the **Data Warehouse** pane, expand **Data Warehouse**, and then click **Data Warehouse Jobs**.  
4.  In the **Data Warehouse Jobs** pane, click **MPSyncJob**.  
5.  In the **Tasks** pane, under **Synchronization**, click **Details**.  
6.  In the **MP Sync Job** dialog box, scroll to the right and examine the **Status** column.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    >  In the **MP Sync Job** dialog box, click **Status** to alphabetically sort the status column.  

7.  Scroll through the **Status** list. The management pack deployment process is complete when **Associated** or **Imported** is listed in the status column for all of the management packs. Make sure that there is no status of either **Pending Association** or **Failed** in the status list. In the **Data Warehouse Jobs** pane, the status of the **MPSyncJob** will have changed from **Running** to **Not Started**. This deployment process can take up to two hours to complete.  
8.  To refresh the **MP Sync Job** dialog box:  
    1.  Press **OK** to close the dialog box.  
    2.  In the **Tasks** pane, in the **Data Warehouse Jobs** area, click **Refresh**.  
    3.  In the **Data Warehouse Jobs** pane, click **MPSyncJobs**.  
    4.  In the **Tasks** pane, under **Synchronization**, click **Details**.  
9. After the management packs have been deployed \(as determined in step 7\), make sure that the following 5 data warehouse jobs are displayed in the **Data Warehouse Jobs** pane:  

    -   Extract\_\<Service Manager management group name\>  
    -   Extract\_\<data warehouse management group name\>  
    -   Load.Common  
    -   Transform.Common  
    -   MPSyncJob  

10. If these 5 data warehouse jobs are not displayed, perform the following procedure:  
    1.  In the **Data Warehouse Jobs** pane, click **MPSyncJob**.  
    2.  In the **Tasks** pane, under **Synchronization**, click **Resume**.  
    3.  Assess if management pack deployment has completed by returning to step 4 above.
