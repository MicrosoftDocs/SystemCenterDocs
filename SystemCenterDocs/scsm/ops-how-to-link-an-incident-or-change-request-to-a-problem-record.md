# Link an incident or change request to a problem record in Service Manager

>Applies To: System Center 2016 - Service Manager

In System Center 2016 - Service Manager, you can use the following procedure to link an incident or change request to a problem record if you created a problem record without linking it to an existing incident or change request.  

## Create a link

1.  In the Service Manager console, click **Work Items**.  

2.  In the **Work Items** pane, expand **Problem Management**, and then click **Active Problems**.  

3.  In the **Active Problems** view, double\-click a problem record. For example, double\-click the **Outlook E\-mail Restricted Permissions** problem record.  

4.  In the problem form, click the **Related Items** tab.  

5.  Under **Work Items**, click **Add**.  

6.  In the **Select objects** dialog box, either select a work item or search for and select one or more work items to link to the problem record. Click **Add**, and then click **OK**.  

7.  Click **OK** to close the form.  

## Validate the link  

-   In the **Active Problems** view, open the problem record to which you linked a work item, click the **Related Items** tab, and then verify that the items you linked appear under **Work Items**.
