# Upgrade your environment to System Center 2016 - Service Manager

You can't start an upgrade to System Center 2016 - Service Manager if any data warehouse jobs or workflows are running. You can use the procedures in this section to stop the data warehouse job schedules and wait for them to complete before you upgrade the data warehouse management server. Before you upgrade the Service Manager management server, stop the Self-Service Portal, if it's installed, and then wait for 10 minutes to let any running workflows finish before you start the upgrade.  

 Complete the procedures in the following section, in order, to upgrade to System Center 2016 - Service Manager.  

## Upgrade preparation

- For Service Manager data warehouse database restoration, the Reporting database also needs to be restored after you install the data warehouse.
- Refer to the upgrade sequencing of System Center components at [Upgrading System Center 2012 R2 - Service Manager to System Center 2016](./upgrade-service-manager.md).
- Don't mix Service Manager 2016 and Service Manager 2012 R2 with different Service Manager components - all should use the same version. For example, both the Self Service portal and the Service Manager management server should use the same version.
- When upgrading from Service Manager 2012 R2 to Service Manager 2016, you shouldn't enable or disable the Active Directory group expansion for any of the Active Directory connectors.

    In other words, if it's off, let it remain off and if it's on, let it remain on until the connector runs for the first time. See the screenshot below. This applies only to the first time that the Active Directory connector runs after you upgrade. You can change your preferences for Active Directory group expansion workflow after the first time the Active Directory connector sync completes.

## Prepare Service Manager 2012 R2 for upgrade

This article describes how to prepare your System Center 2012 R2 - Service Manager environment for an upgrade. To do this, perform the following procedures for upgrading the data warehouse management server:  

1. List the data warehouse jobs that are running and disable them.

2. Confirm that the data warehouse jobs have stopped running.  

3. When the data warehouse jobs have completed, start the upgrade of the data warehouse management server.  

4. After the data warehouse has been upgraded, perform the following procedures on the first Service Manager management server:  

5. Wait for 10 minutes, and then start the upgrade of the Service Manager management server.  

### List the data warehouse jobs by using Windows PowerShell cmdlets and disable them  

1. On the computer that hosts the data warehouse management server, select **Start**, select **All Programs**, select **Microsoft System Center 2012 R2**, and select **Service Manager Shell**.  

2. Enter the following commands, and then press ENTER after each command:  

   ```  
   Set-ExecutionPolicy -force RemoteSigned  
   ```  

   ```  
   cd (Get-ItemProperty -path 'HKLM:\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Microsoft Operations Manager\3.0\Setup\').InstallDirectory
   Import-Module .\Microsoft.EnterpriseManagement.Warehouse.Cmdlets.psd1
   ```  

   ```  
   cd 'C:\Program Files\Microsoft System Center 2012 R2\Service Manager'  
   Import-Module .\Microsoft.EnterpriseManagement.Warehouse.Cmdlets.psd1  

   ```  

   ```  
   get-scdwjob | ? {$_.Name -match 'Extract_'}  | foreach {Disable-SCDWJobSchedule -JobName $_.Name}  
   ```  

3. A list of the data warehouse jobs appears.


### Confirm that the data warehouse jobs have stopped running  

1. In the Service Manager console, select **Data Warehouse**.  

2. In the **Data Warehouse** pane, expand **Data Warehouse**, and select **Data Warehouse Jobs**.  

3. In the **Data Warehouse Jobs** pane, observe the **Status** column for each data warehouse job. When the status for each job is listed as **Not Started**, proceed to the next procedure to stop the Self-Service Portal. If no Self-Service Portal exists in your environment, you can start the upgrade process.  

### Prevent MPSync jobs from failing  

- Run the SQL script below on the DWRepository database to get the SQL scripts that drop and add a constraint on the primary key in fact tables in the DWRepository database to correct the problem  

    ```  
    ;WITH FactName  
    AS (  
           select w.WarehouseEntityName from etl.WarehouseEntity w  
           join etl.WarehouseEntityType t on w.WarehouseEntityTypeId = t.WarehouseEntityTypeId  
           where t.WarehouseEntityTypeName = 'Fact'  
    ),FactList  
    AS (  
        SELECT  PartitionName, p.WarehouseEntityName,  
                RANK() OVER ( PARTITION BY p.WarehouseEntityName ORDER BY PartitionName ASC ) AS RK  
        FROM    etl.TablePartition p  
           join FactName f on p.WarehouseEntityName = f.WarehouseEntityName  
    )  
    , FactPKList  
    AS (  
        SELECT  f.WarehouseEntityName, a.TABLE_NAME, a.COLUMN_NAME, b.CONSTRAINT_NAME, f.RK,  
                CASE WHEN b.CONSTRAINT_NAME = 'PK_' + f.WarehouseEntityName THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS DefaultConstraints  
        FROM    FactList f  
        JOIN    INFORMATION_SCHEMA.KEY_COLUMN_USAGE a ON f.PartitionName = a.TABLE_NAME  
        JOIN    INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TABLE_CONSTRAINTS b ON a.CONSTRAINT_NAME = b.CONSTRAINT_NAME AND b.CONSTRAINT_TYPE = 'Primary key'  
    )  
    , FactWithoutDefaultConstraints  
    AS (  
        SELECT  a.*  
        FROM    FactPKList a  
        LEFT JOIN FactPKList b ON b.WarehouseEntityName = a.WarehouseEntityName AND b.DefaultConstraints = 1  
        WHERE   b.WarehouseEntityName IS NULL AND a.RK = 1  
    )  
    , FactPKListStr  
    AS (  
        SELECT  DISTINCT f1.WarehouseEntityName, f1.TABLE_NAME, f1.CONSTRAINT_NAME, F.COLUMN_NAME AS PKList  
        FROM    FactWithoutDefaultConstraints f1  
        CROSS APPLY (  
                        SELECT  '[' + COLUMN_NAME + '],'  
                        FROM    FactWithoutDefaultConstraints f2  
                        WHERE   f2.TABLE_NAME = f1.TABLE_NAME  
                        ORDER BY COLUMN_NAME  
                    FOR  
                       XML PATH('')  
                    ) AS F (COLUMN_NAME)  
    )  
    SELECT  'ALTER TABLE [dbo].[' + f.TABLE_NAME + '] DROP CONSTRAINT [' + f.CONSTRAINT_NAME + ']' + CHAR(13) + CHAR(10) +  
            'ALTER TABLE [dbo].[' + f.TABLE_NAME + '] ADD CONSTRAINT [PK_' + f.WarehouseEntityName + '] PRIMARY KEY NONCLUSTERED (' + SUBSTRING(f.PKList, 1, LEN(f.PKList) -1) + ')' + CHAR(13) + CHAR(10)  
    FROM    FactPKListStr f  
    ```

## Upgrade to System Center 2016 - Service Manager

Use the following procedures to upgrade your Service Manager environment to System Center 2016 - Service Manager. These procedures include steps for upgrading the data warehouse management server, the Service Manager management server, and the Service Manager console.  

### Upgrade the Service Manager Self Service portal

Refer the instructions mentioned in the [Upgrading the Service Manager Self-Service Portal](upgrade-configs-portal.md) article. In some upgrade scenarios, when you upgrade a management server, the Self Service Portal is also upgraded. In these cases, you need to apply a patch before you upgrade.

### Upgrade steps for custom development

With the System Center 2016 - Service Manager release, the product has moved to support .NET 4.5.1. The tool set to support this movement to .NET 4.5.1 is required to break a few dependencies and has led to the movement of classes across the assemblies. Hence, the upgrade to Service Manager 2016 may break the custom solutions made in-house or by third party (non-Microsoft). Refer the [steps to upgrade your custom solutions](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/servicemanager/2016/08/03/scsm-2016-upgrade-steps-for-custom-development/) to avoid getting into this problem.
