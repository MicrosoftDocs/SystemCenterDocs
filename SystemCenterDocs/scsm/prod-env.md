Use the following procedures to prepare for System Center - Service Manager upgrade by creating a production environment and preparing it for production data for the purpose of upgrade testing.

## Install an additional management server

The following procedure shows how to install an additional management server. You must deploy the initial Service Manager management server and Service Manager Database before deploying an additional management server.  

> [!TIP]  
> You must be a member of the Service Manager Administrators user role in order to install an additional Service Manager management server.  

When you install a secondary management server, data retention settings are reset. Before you install a secondary management server, make a note of the data retention settings. After you've installed the additional management server, adjust the data retention settings to their original values.  

### Run setup

Follow these steps to run setup:

1. By using an account that has administrator rights and that is also a member of the Service Manager Management group administrators, sign in to the computer that will host the additional Service Manager Management server.  
2. On the System Center - Service Manager installation media, double-click Setup.exe.  
3. On the **Microsoft System Center \<version\> Service Manager** page, select **Install a Service Manager Management server**.  
4. On the **Product registration** page, enter the information in the boxes. In the **Product key** boxes, enter the product key you received with Service Manager, or alternatively, select **Install as an evaluation edition (180 day trial)?**. Read the Microsoft Software License Terms, and, if applicable, select **I have read, understood, and agree with the terms of the license agreement**, and select **Next**.  
5. On the **Installation location** page, verify that sufficient free disk space is available, and select **Next**. If necessary, select **Browse** to change the location where the additional Service Manager Management server will be installed.  
6. On the **System check results** page, ensure that the prerequisite check passed or at least passed with warnings, and select **Next**.  
    - If the prerequisite checker determines that the Microsoft Report Viewer Redistributable hasn't been installed, select **Install Microsoft Report Viewer Redistributable**. After the **Microsoft Report Viewer Redistributable 2008 (KB971119) Setup** wizard completes, select **Check perquisites again**.  
7. On the **Configure the Service Manager Database** page, in the **Database server** box, enter the name of the computer that hosts the Service Manager database that you used for your initial Service Manager Management server, and then press TAB. When the name of the instance displays in the **SQL Server instance** box, select **Use an existing database**. For example, enter **Computer 2** in the **Database server** box.  
8. Select the **Database** list, select the database name for the Service Manager database (the default name is ServiceManager), and select **Next**.  
9. On the **Configure the Service Manager Management group** page, verify that the management group name and management group administrators boxes have been populated. Select **Next**.  
10. On the **Configure the Account for Service Manager Services** page, select **Domain account**, specify the user name, password, and domain for the account, and select **Test Credentials**. After you receive a **The credentials were accepted** message, select **Next**. For example, enter the account information for the domain user SM_Acct, and select **Next**.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > The user name and password you provide here must be the same ones used for the Service Manager account on the data warehouse management server.  

11. On the **Diagnostic and usage data** page, indicate your preference for sharing your Service Manager diagnostic and usage data with Microsoft. As an option, select **Privacy statement for System Center Service Manager**, and select **Next**.
12. On the **Use Microsoft Update to help keep your computer secure and up-to-date** page, indicate your preference for using Microsoft Update to check for Service Manager updates, and select **Next**.  
13. On the **Installation summary** page, select **Install**.  
14. On the **Setup completed successfully** page, we recommend that you leave **Open the Encryption Backup or Restore Wizard** selected, and select **Close**.

## Copy customized workflow assembly files

Use the following procedure to copy the workflow assembly files from the Service Manager Installation folder on the primary management server to the secondary management server that you created in the previous procedure.  

### Copy the workflow assembly files

Follow these steps to copy the workflow assembly files:

1. On the computer that is running the Service Manager Primary Server role, browse to the Service Manager Installation folder for example, C:\Program Files\Microsoft System Center\Service Manager copy the workflow files (workflow.dll).  
2. On the computer that is running the Service Manager Secondary server; browse to the Service Manager Installation folder; for example, C:\Program Files\Microsoft System Center\Service Manager. Paste the copied workflow files into this folder. You should overwrite any existing files.  

    > [!NOTE]  
    > You must place the workflow assembly files in the Service Manager installation folder. This is very important step if you want to test the custom workflows that depend on workflow assembly files. Failure to copy these files would lead to failed custom workflows in the lab environment.

## Disable Service Manager connectors in the production environment

Use the following procedure to disable the Service Manager connectors in the production environment:

1. In the Service Manager console, select **Administration**.  
2. In the **Administration** pane, expand **Administration**, and select **Connectors**.

4. In the **Tasks** pane, under the connector name, select **Disable**.  
5. In the **Disable Connector** dialog, select **OK**.

## Disable email notifications in the production environment

Use the following procedure to disable incoming and outbound email notifications in the production environment:

# [Disable outbound email notifications](#tab/DisableOutbound)

Follow these steps to disable outbound email notifications:

1. In the Service Manager console, select **Administration**.
