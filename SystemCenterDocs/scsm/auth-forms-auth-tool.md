This article provides guidelines about how to customize and author forms with the Service Manager Authoring Tool and it describes how to accomplish common authoring tasks.

Use the following guidelines when you're authoring forms in the Service Manager Authoring Tool. For more information about how Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) forms work and WPF customization guidelines, see [Windows Presentation Foundation](/dotnet/desktop/wpf/) on MSDN.  

- When you're customizing the existing default forms by adding new controls, first create a new **Tab** control, and then add the new controls to the new **Tab** control.  
- Store all the customizations of a particular form in a single management pack.  
- Group related controls in a **Panel** control so that you can better handle them as a group.  
- You can drop controls only in containers, such as the **Panel** container control.  
- Set one or more of the following control properties to **Auto** to allow for dynamic adjustment of placement: **Height**, **Width**, **Minimum Height**, **Minimum Width**, **Left**, **Top**, **Right**, and **Bottom**. Depending on the resulting behavior, adjust these settings.  

## Browse a form

Use one of the following procedures to browse a form in the Service Manager Authoring Tool. In both the procedures, ensure that the properties in the **Details** pane are updated according to the class property that is bound to the selected control. Also, the **Binding Path** entry in the **Details** pane indicates the respective property that the field in the form represents.  

### Browse a form from the Form Browser  

1. If the **Form Browser** pane isn't visible, select **View**, and select the **Form Browser** tab.  
2. In the **Form Browser** pane, select the management pack that contains the form that you want to view.  
3. In the list of forms, right-click the form that you want to view, and select **View**. The form opens in the authoring pane.  
4. Ensure that the **Details** pane is visible. If not, select **View** on the menu bar, and select **Details Window**. The properties of the form appear in the **Details** pane.  
5. Select a control on the form.  

### Browse a form from Management Pack Explorer  

1. In the Authoring Tool, select **File**, and select **Open**.  
2. In the **Open a Management Pack** dialog, select the management pack that contains the form that you want to view. For example, select **Management Packs** as the file type, and then select the **ServiceManager.ChangeManagement.Library.mp** management pack in the D:\\Program Files \(x86\)\\Microsoft System Center\\Service Manager \<version\> Authoring\\Library folder.  
3. In the **Management Pack Explorer**, select the opened management pack, and then expand **Forms**. Right-click the form that you want to view, and select **View form**. The form opens in the authoring pane.  
4. Ensure that the **Details** pane is visible. If not, select **View** on the menu bar, and select **Details Window**. The properties of the form appear in the **Details** pane.  
5. Select a control on the form.  

## Customize a form

You can use the Service Manager Authoring Tool to customize some properties of a form. For example, you can change the layout of the form's fields, and you can add an icon to the form.  

To customize a form, you open the management pack file that contains the original form definition. After you complete the customizations, you save the changes to a management pack file. If the original form is defined in an unsealed management pack, you save your customizations to that management pack. If the original form is defined in a sealed management pack, you must save your customizations to an unsealed management pack that is already open in the Authoring Tool or to an unsealed management pack that you create.  

To use the custom form in Service Manager, import the management pack that contains the custom form into the Service Manager console. Then, when you run a task that requires that form, the custom form is displayed instead of the default form.  

Use the following procedure to customize an existing form.  

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> You can't perform two customizations to the same form at the same time. Additionally, the Authoring Tool option **Undo all customizations** doesn't fully delete information from the management pack. If you want to remove all artifacts, delete the customized form, which removes it and any associated type projection from the management pack.  

### Customize an existing form  

1. In the Authoring Tool, select **File**, and select **Open**.  
2. In the **Open File** dialog, select the management pack that contains the form that you want to customize, and select **Open**. For example, select the Change Management Library management pack. The path might be *Authoring Tool installation drive*\\Program Files \(x86\)\\Microsoft System Center\\Service Manager \<version\> Authoring\\Library\\ServiceManager.ChangeManagement.Library.mp.  
3. Locate the form that you want to customize using the **Form Browser** or the **Management Pack Explorer**, as follows:  
     Using the **Form Browser**:  
    1. In the **Form Browser**, select **All Management Packs** or select the management pack that contains the form that you want to customize, such as the **Service Manager Change Management Library** management pack.  
    2. Right-click the form that you want to customize, such as the form that ends with **ChangeRequestForm**, and select **View**.  
    3. In the authoring pane, select **Customize**.  
     Using the **Management Pack Explorer**:  
        1. In the **Management Pack Explorer** pane, select the management pack that contains the form that you want to customize, such as the **Service Manager Change Management Library** management pack.  
        2. Expand **Forms**, and then right-click the form that you want to customize, such as the form that ends with **ChangeRequestForm**.  
        3. Select **Customize**.  
4. In the **Target Management Pack** dialog, select an unsealed management pack in which to save this customization, and select **OK**.  
    In the **Management Pack Explorer** pane, a new form item appears in the **Forms** list of the management pack that you specified as the targeted management pack. The name of the new form ends with the string **(Customized)**.  
5. In the authoring pane, you can rearrange the location of the controls on the form to change the appearance and behavior of the form. Also, you can add controls to the form by doing the following:  
    - Drag controls from the **Form Customization Toolbox** pane.  
    - Drag specific properties from the **Class Browser** pane. This will automatically create and bind the control according to the property that you dragged.  

## Create a new form

If you defined a new custom class to extend Service Manager, you might have to create a custom form to interact with that class. You can use the Service Manager Authoring Tool to create a form using either of the following methods:  

- Start from a base class.  
- Load a custom Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) form that was initially developed by the Microsoft Visual Studio development system, and continue to customize that form in the Authoring Tool.  

The Authoring Tool includes form controls, such as the **Check Box**, **Date Picker**, **Tab Control**, and **Tab Item**, that you can add to the form. You can access these controls from the **Form Customizations Toolbox**. Typically, you bind the form controls to specific properties of the form's base class. Therefore, using either method you must first select a base class for the form to be associated with. For more information about the controls that you can add to a form, see the previous sections in this article, such as [How to Add a Check Box Control to a Form in the Authoring Tool](#add-a-check-box-control-to-a-form) and [How to Add a Tab Control and Tab Item Controls to a Form in the Authoring Tool](#add-a-tab-control-and-tab-item-controls-to-a-form).  

The following sections describe how to create a new form in the Authoring Tool.  

### Create a new form from a base class  

Use the following procedure to create a simple form from a base class.  

> [!NOTE]  
> When you create a form from a base class, the Authoring Tool doesn't support advanced capabilities. For example, there's no support for code-behind, complex rules such as field interdependency or calculated values.  

#### Create a new form from a base class

1. In the **Management Pack Explorer**, expand the management pack in which you want to store the new form. Right-click **Forms**, and select **Create**.  
2. In the **Base class** dialog, select the base class for the form. You can narrow your search by selecting a specific management pack, or you can leave the default **All Management Packs**. Select **OK**.  
3. If you selected a sealed management pack in step 1, the **Target Management Pack** dialog appears. Select an unsealed management pack in which to store the form, and select **OK**.  
4. In the **Create form** dialog, in the **Internal name** box, enter a name for the form, and select **Create**.  
     An initial blank form is displayed in the authoring pane. The initial form consists of a header section at the top and a body section underneath; both sections are blank.  
5. Customize the form by dragging controls from the **Form Customizations Toolbox** pane to the new form.  
6. Save the management pack that contains the form that you created.  

### Create a new form that is based on a custom WPF form

Sometimes a simple form isn't sufficient, and you must use advanced features, such as custom logic, in the form. In this case, you can develop a custom WPF form by using a tool other than the Authoring Tool instead of using Visual Studio. Then, instead of authoring a form from base class, you load that WPF form's assembly file into the Authoring Tool and use that as a starting point for further customizations to the form. The form customizations that you make in the Authoring Tool are stored in a management pack file.  

Later, to use the customized form in Service Manager, after you complete all customizations, you must bundle the original form assembly file with the management pack that contains the customizations that you made in the Authoring Tool. For more information about bundling a management pack and creating a .mpb file, see [How to Bundle Management Packs and Resource Files](bundle-mps.md).  

Use the following procedure to load a custom WPF form assembly file into the Service Manager and customize that form.  

#### Create a new form that is based on a custom WPF form

1. In the **Management Pack Explorer**, expand the management pack in which you want to store customizations to the form. Right-click **Forms**, and select **Add Custom**.  
2. In the **Base class** dialog, select the base class for the form. You can narrow your search by selecting a specific management pack, or keep the default **All Management Packs**. Select **OK**.  
3. If you selected a sealed management pack in step 1, the **Target Management Pack** dialog appears. Select an unsealed management pack in which to store the form, and select **OK**.  
4. In the **Add custom form** dialog, enter a name in the **Internal name** box. In the **Assembly** box, select the assembly file that contains the custom form that you want to load, and in the **Type** box, select the name of the form from the assembly file that you want to load. Select **Create**. The form that you selected is now displayed in the authoring pane.  
5. Customize the form by dragging controls from the **Form Customizations Toolbox** pane to the form on the authoring pane.  
6. Save the management pack that contains the customizations of the form.  
7. Bundle the form's original assembly file, the management pack that contains the form customizations that you made in the Authoring Tool, and any other resource files that you need, to create an .mpb file.  

## Add a check box control to a form

A **Check Box** control in the Service Manager Authoring Tool presents an option on the form, and lets the user choose that option. You can modify the properties of the **Check Box** control to customize characteristics such as the label that is displayed on the check box.  

Use the following procedure to add a **Check Box** control to a form.  

### Add a Check Box control to a form  

1. Ensure that the **Form Customization Toolbox** pane is open and that the form you want to customize is open in the authoring pane.

3. In the **Details** pane, select the **Content** property and set its value to text that will be displayed on the check box.  
4. In the **Details** pane, select the **Binding Path** property, and select the ellipsis button (**...**). In the **Binding Path** dialog, expand the classes, and then select a **Boolean** property for the control to bind to.
    > [!NOTE]
    > The **Content** property is automatically set to the display name of the property that the control is bound to.  
5. Select any other property, such as **Font Family**, in the **Details** pane to customize the properties of the **Check Box** control.  
6. Select **File**, and select **Save All** to save the custom form to a management pack.  

## Add a date picker control to a form

A **Date Picker** control in the Service Manager Authoring Tool is used for displaying dates on a form. You can modify the properties of the **Date Picker** control to customize characteristics such as the format of the date that is displayed.  

Use the following procedure to add a **Date Picker** control to a form.
