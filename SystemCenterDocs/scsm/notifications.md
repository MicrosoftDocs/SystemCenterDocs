Using Service Manager notifications, you can generate emails for almost any kind of change. For example, you can configure notifications to be sent to an analyst when changes occur to a work item or configuration item that pertains to email problems.

Before notifications are sent, first configure each notification channel, such as the settings for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP). Notification messages are sent based on a notification template. Therefore, you must create a notification template. You can then use the Notification Subscription Wizard to subscribe a group of users to a notification that will be sent whenever the changes that you specify occur. Finally, you can verify that a notification is sent by manually generating the change.

> [!NOTE]
> You must add the Service Manager workflow account to the Service Manager Administrators user role for notifications to function properly.

## Substitution strings in notification templates

Substitution strings are special tokens or system variables that are used in notification templates in Service Manager. These strings retrieve properties from an instance that is related to the instance for which the template was created. The strings then display the value in the notification email. Notification templates in Service Manager include substitution strings. Although you should avoid modifying the predefined templates, you can duplicate them and then modify the duplicates.

For example, the end-user notification template includes a substitution string in the message body that represents the user's first name. If you want to add the user's last name, you can easily do so by using the **Insert** button, which is available when you edit a notification template, and then browsing the available strings that are available for the class of template that you're modifying. In this example, you would browse and then select **Affected User** and then select **Last Name** to insert the string into the template. Later, when the notification is sent to the user, their first and last name is included in the message as a salutation.

While this example is simple, Service Manager includes substitution strings for almost every property that you might need to create notifications that can inform end-users and other Service Manager users with very timely and relevant information. You can easily view the substitution strings that are available in Service Manager by opening an existing notification template and then, in the template design area, selecting the **Insert** button to view the classes and properties.


## Configure notification channels

You can use the following procedures to configure notification channels and validate the configuration. Notification channels are the method by which notification messages are sent to users. You use the **Configure E-Mail Notification Channel** dialog to configure and enable email notifications that Service Manager sends to a Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) server.

> [!NOTE]
> Only email notification is supported.

## Send notifications using external email authentication

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) implements OAuth protocol for secure authentication of its users and applications. Here's how the connection establishes when the activity runs:

1. Obtains user credentials from IP configuration.

2. Uses the credentials to authenticate with Azure AD using OAuth.

3. After authentication, you will receive an OAuth token from Azure AD.

4. Activity performs operations on the EWS endpoint using the OAuth token.

     - **Client Id**: Enter the client ID created in the previous steps.

     - **Tenant Id**: Enter the tenant ID created in the previous steps.

     - **Mail Id**: Enter the mail ID that acts as a sender for notifications.

     - **Password**: Enter the corresponding password.

           :::image type="Add SMTP server" source="media/notifications/add-smtp-server-inline.png" alt-text="screenshot of add SMTP server." lightbox="media/notifications/add-smtp-server-expanded.png":::

4. Select **OK** to save the changes.

5. Enter **Return e-mail address** and set **Retry primary after** as required and select **OK**.

Use this channel for sending notifications/outgoing e-mails.

An additional setup of connector/SMTP relay and SMTP details such as FQDN and port number are not required while you use External E-mail Authentication mode for sending notifications. Therefore, FQDN and port number values are set to random values as NA and 65534 when a channel is created using this authentication method.

### Troubleshooting

Each time Notification part runs, it logs events into the event viewer. In case of unexpected behavior, check events to troubleshoot. For more information or for debugging purposes, refer EWS Traces in events. To display trace and logs in the event viewer, open command prompt in administrator mode in the Service Manager Console machine and set the env var EXTERNALEWSLogs value to 1 (setx /m EXTERNALEWSLogs 1).

Setting EXTERNALEWSLogs to 1 enables trace and logs to be shown in event viewer as follows:

## Create notification templates

You can use the following procedures to create notification templates for many types of information records or work items that Service Manager records or keeps track of, such as incidents, change requests, activities, release records, and configuration items. After you create the notification templates, you can use a notification subscription to send email messages based on the templates. The notification template determines the type and format of the messages to send.

> [!NOTE]
> Manually copying and pasting substitution strings from other notification templates won't generally work. Therefore, you should avoid copying them to prevent errors. Instead, you can easily browse for and insert available substitution strings into any notification template that you're creating or updating.


The following two templates are prerequisites for other procedures:

-   The New Activity Assigned Received Template.
-   The New Standard Change Request Received Template.

## Subscribe to notifications

After you create a notification template, and after you've enabled at least one notification channel, you can use the following procedure to subscribe to notifications by using the Notification Subscription Wizard. Then, notifications will be sent when an object is created or updated or periodically when other criteria that you specify are met.

The scenarios in this article center on the Create E-Mail Notification Subscription Wizard. The condition that you choose to notify will dynamically change the wizard pages that are available.

In the first procedure, you set up a subscription so that a messaging analyst is notified when a new incident that pertains to an email problem is opened. In the second procedure, you set up a subscription so that daily status updates are sent to the release manager while the HR web application is in development, testing, and deployment.

> [!NOTE]
> Some notification criteria values might not change. If you want to receive a notification when a change occurs, ensure that you choose a value for an object that is likely to change. For example, the **Incident ID** for an incident doesn't change.

### To validate a notification subscription

-   Locate the notification subscription that you created in the list of subscriptions.

![Screenshot of the PowerShell symbol.](./media/notifications/pssymbol.png)You can use a Windows PowerShell command to complete these tasks and other related tasks, as follows:

-   For information about how to use Windows PowerShell to create a new subscription in Service Manager, see [New-SCSMSubscription](/previous-versions/system-center/powershell/system-center-2012-r2/hh316196(v=sc.20)).
-   For information about how to use Windows PowerShell to retrieve subscriptions that are configured in Service Manager, see [Get-SCSMSubscription](/previous-versions/system-center/powershell/system-center-2012-r2/hh316211(v=sc.20)).
-   For information about how to use Windows PowerShell to update subscription properties in Service Manager, see [Update-SCSMSubscription](/previous-versions/system-center/powershell/system-center-2012-r2/hh316242(v=sc.20)).
-   For information about how to use Windows PowerShell to remove a subscription from Service Manager, see [Remove-SCSMSubscription](/previous-versions/system-center/powershell/system-center-2012-r2/hh316257(v=sc.20)).

## Verify a notification configuration

You can use the following procedure to verify that you've correctly configured notifications. Generate the type of change that activates the notification subscription that was previously created. When you do this, the subscription generates and then sends a notification. Receipt of the notification verifies success. For example, create a test incident that generates an email notification. The notification informs the recipient that an incident was opened.

If you're verifying a recurring notification subscription, you must wait for the time interval that you set previously to elapse until the notification is sent. When the notification is received, the configuration of the notification is verified.

### To verify a notification configuration

1.  In the Service Manager console, select **Work Items**.
2.  In the **Work Items** pane, expand **Work Items**, expand **Incident Management**, and select **All Open Incidents**.
3.  In the **Tasks** pane, under **Incident Management**, select **Create Incident**.
4.  In the **Incident *Number* New** form, enter the required information in the **Affected user**, **Title**, **Classification Category**, **Impact**, and **Urgency** boxes.
5.  In the **Classification Category** list, select **E-mail Problems**, and select **OK**.
6.  Verify that an email notification that contains the information you entered in the template is received. The email title should contain the incident ID number.

## Automatically notify groups of Service Manager users

In some situations, you may want to use a group rather than an individual user in Service Manager as a work item stakeholder. For example, you might want to assign an incident to a team of people, such as an initial response team that routes incidents, and then notify everyone in the initial response team that an incident has been assigned to their team.

Messaging-enabled universal security groups in Microsoft Exchange Server are the key to this task. This article describes how to accomplish this using the Exchange Server Exchange Management console for incidents. You can use the following procedures to create a messaging-enabled universal security group, create a workflow to notify stakeholders when an incident is created, and then test for success.

In Exchange Server, the **Require that all senders are authenticated** setting is enabled by default for mail-enabled universal security groups. You can modify the setting in the distribution group properties, in Mail-Flow settings, in the **Message Delivery Restrictions** dialog. If your outgoing Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) server specified in the Service Manager settings (Under **Administration** > **Notifications Channels** > **Edit**) is using Anonymous as the Authentication Method (either in  Service Manager or the SMTP settings), then given the above default setting in exchange, the email wouldn't be sent out. If you've Anonymous Access configured on the SMTP side, it's necessary either to clear the **Require that all senders are authenticated** setting in exchange for the Mail Enabled Universal Security Group, or change the SMTP authentication settings (in Service Manager or the outgoing SMTP Server settings) from anonymous to Windows Integrated, so that the user is authenticated, allowing the email to be sent.

As an alternative, you can avoid using **Assigned to** and instead use **Support Group** changing as a triggering field. To set this up, create a new email notification subscription, and under additional criteria, use the following:

-   Changed from: [incident] Support Group Does not equal Tier 1
-   Changed to: [incident] Support Group equals Tier 1

Use whatever template you want, and add the recipient of the mailing distribution list for Tier 1. Now Tier 1 is notified whenever a ticket is sent to them, even if it's done by means of a template at portal ticket creation.

Setting up one of these for each support group will ensure that all your groups are informed of incoming incidents that require their attention.

### To create a messaging-enabled universal security group

1.  In the Exchange Management Console, navigate to **Recipient Configuration**, right-click **Distribution Group**, and select **New Distribution Group**.
2.  On the **Introduction** page, either choose an existing universal group or create a new group.
3.  On the **Group Information** page, select the **Security** group type.
4.  Complete the creation of the group.
5.  Add members to the group by right-clicking them, selecting **Properties**, and accessing the **Members** tab.
6.  Wait for Service Manager to sync with Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS), or perform a manual Synchronization from **Administration** > **Connectors**. (Select **AD Connector**, and then select the **Synchronize Now** task on the right-hand side).
7.  Once the Active Directory synchronization has completed, the newly created group will be available as a configuration item in Service Manager, and it can be selected in the user picker fields, such as **Affected User** and **Assigned To**.

### To create a workflow to notify stakeholders when an incident is created

1.  Navigate to **Administration** > **Workflows** > **Configuration**.
2.  Double-click **Incident Event Workflow Configuration**.
3.  Select **Add**, and select **Next** on the **Before you Begin** page.
4.  Give the workflow a name, such as *Incident Created Email Stakeholders*.
5.  Leave the default of **When an incident is created** in the **Check for Events** dropdown list.
6.  Select one of your custom management packs (or create one) to store the workflow in, and select **Next**.
7.  Select **Next** on the **Specify Incident Criteria** page. (We want this workflow to run when any new incident is created.)
8.  Optionally, apply a template. (In this case, we're creating the workflow for notification only, so we choose **Do not apply a template**.)
9. In the **Select People to Notify** dialog, select the **Enable notification** checkbox. Add the appropriate users you want to notify with the appropriate templates.
10. Select Next, and select **Create** to complete creation of the workflow.

### To test the workflow and mail the enabled universal security group

- Create an incident and assign it to the messaging-enabled universal security group that you created earlier.
