# Configuring storage using Scale-Out File Servers in VMM
You can use [!INCLUDE[vmm12sp1_long](./Token/vmm12sp1_long_md.md)] to configure a Scale\-Out File Server cluster as the storage for Hyper\-V hosts or host clusters. If your Scale\-Out File Server cluster runs [!INCLUDE[winthreshold_server_2](./Token/winthreshold_server_2_md.md)], you can configure it with Storage Spaces Direct, which is described in [Storage Spaces Direct in Windows Server Technical Preview](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt126109.aspx).

This section focuses on the process after a Scale\-Out File Server cluster already exists and is under management in [!INCLUDE[vmm12short](./Token/vmm12short_md.md)]. For links to topics about cluster creation, see [Stage 1: Discover storage during creation of your Scale-Out File Server](./Overview--configuring-storage-using-Scale-Out-File-Servers-in-VMM.md#BKMK_discovery) in "Overview: configuring storage using Scale\-Out File Server clusters in VMM."
