# How to Update the Portal Title and Image
You can make limited customizations to the SharePoint Web parts that make up the [!INCLUDE[smssp](Token/smssp_md.md)]. You can customize the left pane navigational elements, the home page title, image, and the web\-parts that present data to the web user by using the **Site Actions** menu on **Site Pages**. By using this procedure, you can make changes to the following items to customize the [!INCLUDE[smssp](Token/smssp_md.md)] for your environment:

-   Title

-   Image

### To update the portal title and image

1.  Start a browser and connect to the [!INCLUDE[smssp](Token/smssp_md.md)] home page, for example, *http:\/\/<SiteName>:81\/SMPortal*.

2.  In the upper left corner, click **Site Actions**, and then click **Site Settings**.

3.  On the **Site Settings** page, in the **Look and Feel** area, click **Title, description, and icon**.

4.  Follow the on\-screen directions to change the title, logo, and website address, and then click **OK**.
