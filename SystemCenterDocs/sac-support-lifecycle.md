# Support for System Center Semi-Annual Channel releases

Microsoft plans to release updates for System Center Semi-Annual Channel (SAC) a few times per year. Each Semi-Annual Channel version is in support for 18 months from its general availability (GA) release date. Technical support is provided for the entire period of support. However, Microsoft's support structure is dynamic, evolving into two distinct servicing phases that depend on the availability of the latest Semi-annual channel version.

- **Security and Critical Updates servicing phase** - When running the latest Semi-Annual Channel version of System Center, you receive both Security and Critical updates.
- **Security Updates (Only) servicing phase** - After the release of a new Semi-Annual Channel version, older branch support reduces to Security updates only, for the remainder of that version's support lifecycle.  


> [!NOTE]
> The latest Semi-Annual Channel version is always in the Security and Critical Updates servicing phase. If you encounter a code defect that warrants a critical update, you must have the latest Semi-Annual Channel version installed to receive a fix. All other supported Semi-Annual Channel versions are only eligible to receive security updates. Microsoft recommends updating your deployment to the latest version before support for your current version expires.
