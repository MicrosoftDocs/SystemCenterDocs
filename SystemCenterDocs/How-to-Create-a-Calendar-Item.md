# How to Create a Calendar Item
You create a calendar item to define work days, work hours, and holidays in Service Manager. After you create a calendar item, you will use it as part of a service level objective, where it is measured against a time metric.

### To create a calendar item

1.  In the [!INCLUDE[smcons](../Token/smcons_md.md)], click **Administration**.

2.  In the **Administration** pane, expand **Service Level Management**, and then click **Calendar**.

3.  In the **Tasks** pane, under **Calendar**, click **Create Calendar**.

4.  In the **Create\/Edit Calendar** dialog box, in the **Title** box, type a title for the calendar. For example, type **Normal Work Calendar**.

5.  In the **Time zone** list, select the time zone of your location.

6.  Under **Working days and hours**, select the work days of your organization and for each selected day, type the start and end time for each day.

7.  Under **Holidays**, click **Add** to define any holidays that your organization does not normally work. In the **Add Holiday** dialog box, type the name and select the date of the holiday and then click **OK** to close the dialog box.

8.  Click **OK** to close the **Create\/Edit Calendar** dialog box.
