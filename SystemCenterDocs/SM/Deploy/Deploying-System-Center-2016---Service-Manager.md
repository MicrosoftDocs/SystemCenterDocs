# Deploying System Center 2016 - Service Manager
This guide helps you deploy [!INCLUDE[scsm_threshold_1](../../Token/scsm_threshold_1_md.md)] in one of several different scenarios. The scenarios range from a simple, two\-computer scenario to a four\-computer scenario that is designed to support production\-type environments. In addition, this guide shows you how to register a [!INCLUDE[smshort](../../Token/smshort_md.md)] management group with the [!INCLUDE[smshort](../../Token/smshort_md.md)] data warehouse so that you can generate reports. You have the option of deploying the [!INCLUDE[smssp](../../Token/smssp_md.md)] so you can provide access to [!INCLUDE[smshort](../../Token/smshort_md.md)] through a web browser. To improve performance and provide for redundancy, you can deploy additional secondary [!INCLUDE[smshort](../../Token/smshort_md.md)] management servers.

> [!NOTE]
> It is assumed in this guide that you are installing [!INCLUDE[smshort](../../Token/smshort_md.md)] on a computer where no previous version of [!INCLUDE[smshort](../../Token/smshort_md.md)] is installed.

This guide also describes how to find and read the Setup log if you encounter issues when you deploy [!INCLUDE[smshort](../../Token/smshort_md.md)]. And, finally, information about backing up [!INCLUDE[smshort](../../Token/smshort_md.md)] management server encryption keys is included. After you run Setup, the Encryption Key Backup and Restore Wizard starts automatically.
