# Managing Incidents and Problems in Service Manager
[!INCLUDE[scsm_threshold_1](Token/scsm_threshold_1_md.md)] helps your organization manage incidents and problems by implementing and automating help desk ticketing processes so that these processes comply with the best practices that are described in the Microsoft Operations Framework \(MOF\) and in the Information Technology Infrastructure Library \(ITIL\). For more information about MOFÂ 4.0, see [Microsoft Operations Framework](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=116391).

If you need to add or extend the functionality of [!INCLUDE[smshort](Token/smshort_md.md)] to implement custom processes for handling incidents and problems, you can use standard Microsoft development tools and the [!INCLUDE[smshort](Token/smshort_md.md)] SDK.

The procedures in this section are organized according to common problem and incident management scenarios. Even though the sample scenarios refer to a fictitious organization, Woodgrove Bank, the scenarios and steps are based on real use and they describe how to use the problem and incident management features in [!INCLUDE[smshort](Token/smshort_md.md)].

At first, the difference between affected items and related items in problem and incident forms might not be obvious. However the difference describes different relationships. An affected item is something that is directly affected by the problem or incident, for example, your computer. Whereas, a related item is something more loosely related but not directly affected. For example, a related item could be any other configuration item that is not directly affected but connected to another configuration item as a reference.

## To Manage Incidents and Problems

-   Manage incidents by creating, editing, and resolving incidents.

-   [Manually Create a New Incident](Manually-Create-a-New-Incident.md)

-   [Contact a User from an Incident Form](Contact-a-User-from-an-Incident-Form.md)

-   [Combine Incidents into Parent-Child Groups](Combine-Incidents-into-Parent-Child-Groups.md)

-   Manage problems by creating and editing problem records, resolve problems and related incidents automatically, and link incidents or change requests to a problem record.
