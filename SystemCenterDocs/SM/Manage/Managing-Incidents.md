# Managing Incidents
The procedures in this section describe how to manage incidents by using [!INCLUDE[scsm_threshold_1](../../Token/scsm_threshold_1_md.md)].

Help desk analysts use incident management to restore regular operations as quickly and as cost\-effectively as possible by creating new incidents. They also work in partnership with [!INCLUDE[smshort](../../Token/smshort_md.md)] administrators to ensure that incidents that are created automatically or by end users are correctly categorized and reassigned to appropriate personnel. Methods that you might use to accomplish these duties include:

-   Using the E\-mail Incident template to create new incidents.

-   Reviewing automatically created incidents, such as those incidents that are automatically created from System Center Operations ManagerÂ 2007 using the Operations Manager Alert connector.

-   Reviewing and updating incidents that are created by end users who have sent requests by email.

-   Combining incidents into parent\-child relationships when incidents are related.
