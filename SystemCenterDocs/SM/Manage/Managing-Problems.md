# Managing Problems
This section describes how to manage problems in [!INCLUDE[smshort](../../Token/smshort_md.md)].

In [!INCLUDE[smshort](../../Token/smshort_md.md)], problems are records that are created to help prevent future problems and incidents from happening, to eliminate recurring incidents, and to minimize the impact of incidents that cannot be prevented. Analysts can use the [!INCLUDE[smcons](../../Token/smcons_md.md)] to create problem records and to associate incidents with problems.

## To manage problems
Complete these steps to manage problems in [!INCLUDE[smshort](../../Token/smshort_md.md)].

1.  Create and edit problem records to group related incidents

2.  Resolve a single problem to automatically close the related incidents

3.  Link an incident or change request to an associated problem record
