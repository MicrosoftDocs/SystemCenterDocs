# How to Set File Attachment Limits
Use the following procedure to limit the number and size of files that can be attached to an incident in Service Manager. In this example, set the maximum number of files to 5 and the maximum file size to 500 kilobytes \(KB\).

### To set file attachment limits

1.  In the [!INCLUDE[smcons](../../includes/smcons_md.md)], click **Administration**.

2.  In the **Administration** pane, expand **Administration**, and then click **Settings**.

3.  In the **Settings** pane, click **Incident Settings**.

4.  In the **Tasks** pane, under **Incident Settings**, click **Properties**.

5.  In the **Incident Settings** dialog box, click **General**.

6.  Set **Maximum number of attached files** to **5**.

7.  Set **Maximum size \(KB\)** to **500**, and then click **OK**.

### To validate file attachment limits

-   When you create a new incident or edit an existing one, no more than five files can be attached, and each file can be no larger than 500 KB.
