# Back up and restore SharePoint
You can deploy DPM to protect SharePoint farms, external SQL Server databases, and folders that include farm customizations.

-   SharePoint databases using AlwaysOn can be protected from DPM 2012 R2 with Update 5 onwards.

-   You can’t protect SharePoint databases as a SQL Server data source. You can recover individual databases from a farm backup.

-   You’ll need to be running at least System Center 2012 R2 Data Protection Manager to protect SharePoint 2013.

You set up SharePoint protect as follows:

1.  [Prerequisites for SharePoint protection](./Prerequisites-for-SharePoint-protection.md)—Read these before you begin deployment.

2.  [Configure SharePoint Protection](./Configure-SharePoint-Protection.md)—Walk through the steps to configure protection

3.  [Recover SharePoint data](./Recover-SharePoint-data.md)—Learn how to recover backed up data.
