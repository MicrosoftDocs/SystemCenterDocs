# How to open a new session while you are logged on to the VMM console
To create services and deploy services to a private cloud as a self\-service user, you must use the [!INCLUDE[vmm12sp1_long](Token/vmm12sp1_long_md.md)] console. If you are logged on to the [!INCLUDE[vmm12short](Token/vmm12short_md.md)] console as an administrator, and you also are a member of a self\-service user role, you can open a new session under the self\-service user role. The following procedure explains how to open a new session while you are logged on to the [!INCLUDE[vmm12short](Token/vmm12short_md.md)] console.

### To open a new [!INCLUDE[vmm12short](Token/vmm12short_md.md)] session while you are logged on to the [!INCLUDE[vmm12short](Token/vmm12short_md.md)] console

1.  From any workspace in the [!INCLUDE[vmm12short](Token/vmm12short_md.md)] console, click the down arrow at the top left corner of the ribbon, and then click **Open New Connection**.

2.  In the **Connect to Server** dialog box, click **Connect** to start a second session with the current [!INCLUDE[vmm12short](Token/vmm12short_md.md)] instance.

3.  In the **Select User Role** dialog box, select the user role you want to log on under, and then click **OK**.

    A new instance of the [!INCLUDE[vmm12short](Token/vmm12short_md.md)] console opens, and the previous [!INCLUDE[vmm12short](Token/vmm12short_md.md)] session remains open. You can determine which session you are using by viewing the title bar, because the title bar contains the name of the user role that is being used.
