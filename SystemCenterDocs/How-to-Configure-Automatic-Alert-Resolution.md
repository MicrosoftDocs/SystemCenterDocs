# How to Configure Automatic Alert Resolution
In [!INCLUDE[om12long](./Token/om12long_md.md)], alerts are resolved automatically after a specific number of days. You can change the automatic alert resolution settings globally for the management group. Using automatic alert resolution, you can configure all active alerts with a resolution state of **New** to be changed to **Closed** after a specific number of days.
