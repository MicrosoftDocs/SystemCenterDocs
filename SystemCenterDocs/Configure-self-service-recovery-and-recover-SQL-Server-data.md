# Configure self-service recovery and recover SQL Server data
Data Protection Manager \(DPM\) provides a self\-service recovery feature to allow SQL Server administrators access to data protected by DPM, so that they can restore a SQL Server database from backup to a network folder.

You use the DPM Self\-Service Recovery Configuration Toll to create and manage roles that specify which users can perform self\-service recovery. Then users use the DPM Self\-Service Recovery Wizard to recover SQL Server databases.
