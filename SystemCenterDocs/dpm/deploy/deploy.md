>Applies To: System Center 2016 - Data Protection Manager

When deploying DPM, you start off by identifying the data that you want to protect and recover, and then installing the DPM protection agent on those computers that contain the data. Use the following articles to start your deployment:
- [Deploy the DPM protection agent](./deploy-the-dpm-protection-agent.md)
- [Deploy protection groups](./deploy-protection-groups.md)
- [Deduplicate DPM storage](./deduplicate-dpm-storage.md)

Then use the applicable article for the specific workload that you want to protect with DPM:

- [Back up Hyper-V virtual machines](./back-up-hyper-v-virtual-machines.md)
- [Back up Exchange servers](./back-up-exchange-with-dpm.md)
- [Back up SharePoint servers](./back-up-sharepoint-with-dpm.md)
- [Back up SQL server](./back-up-sql-server-with-dpm.md)
- [Back up client computers](./back-up-client-computers-with-dpm.md)
- [Back up file data](./back-up-file-data-with-dpm.md)
- [Back up VMM servers](./back-up-and-restore-vmm-servers.md)
- [Back up DPM servers](./back-up-the-dpm-server.md)
