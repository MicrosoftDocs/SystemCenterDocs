# What can DPM back up?

This article summarizes System Center Data Protection Manager (DPM) protection support.

## Cluster support
DPM can protect data in the following clustered applications:

-   File servers

-   SQL Server

-   Hyper-V - But if you're protecting a Hyper-V cluster using scaled-out DPM protection, you can't add secondary protection for the protected Hyper-V workloads.

    For Hyper-V running on Windows Server 2008 R2 make sure you have the updated described in KB [975354](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/975354) installed.
    For Hyper-V running on Windows Server 2008 R2 in a cluster configuration make sure you have SP2 and KB [971394](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/971394) installed.

-   Exchange Server - DPM can protect non-shared disk clusters for supported Exchange Server versions (cluster continuous replication), and can also protect Exchange Server configured for local continuous replication.

-   SQL Server - Note that DPM doesn't support the protection of SQL Server databases hosted on cluster-shared volumes (CSVs).

DPM can protect cluster workloads that are located in the same domain as the DPM server, and in a child or trusted domain. If you want to protect data source in untrusted domains or workgroups you'll need to use NTLM or certificate authentication for a single server, or certificate authentication only for a cluster.
