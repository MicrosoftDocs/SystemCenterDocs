# Set up DPM logging

>Applies To: System Center 2016 - Data Protection Manager

System Center Data Protection Manager (DPM) logs activity in log files (*.errlog).  Log files are tab delimited and can be opened in Excel for easy viewing. You can filter with specific levels and task IDs in order to find events that interest you. Every log entry has a log task ID generated by DPM as a unique GUID for every DPM task. This helps you to track down log entries for specific jobs. Log files are located as follows:

-   **DPM installation information**: Logged on the DPM server at C:\DPMLogs. For DPM 2012 R2 the location is
    %ProgramFiles%\Microsoft System Center 2012 R2\DPM\DPMLogs.

-   **DPM activity information**: Logged on the DPM server at %ProgramFiles%\Microsoft DPM\DPM\Temp. For DPM 2012 R2 the location is
    %ProgramFiles%\Microsoft System Center 2012 R2\DPM\DPM\Temp.

-   **Protected client activity**: Logged on the client computer at %ProgramFiles%\Microsoft Data Protection Manager\DPM\Temp
    Logs. Client-initiated activities such as self-service recovery are logged on the client computer based on the user (%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Microsoft System Center Data Protection Manager 2012\\)

You can  tweak log file settings as follows:

|Value name|Value type/Allowed values|Details|
|--------------|------------------------------|-----------|
|TraceLogLevel|DWORD<br /><br />TRACE_ERROR - Logs all errors and failures - default setting<br /><br />TRACE_DBG_ACTIVITY - Logs all activities such as start, cancel, end<br /><br />TRACE_DBG_NORMAL - Logs activities considered important<br /><br />TRACE_DBG_CRITICAL - Logs critical errors only.<br /><br />TRACE_DBG_FATAL - Logs fatal errors such as task or job failures|Specifies the logging level.<br /><br />Can be overridden per binary. A valid bitmask of allowed values is:<br /><br />enum TRACE_FLAG{<br /><br />TRACE_ERROR = 0x2,<br /><br />TRACE_DBG_ACTIVITY = 0x4,<br /><br />TRACE_DBG_       = 0x8,<br /><br />TRACE_PERF = 0x20,<br /><br />TRACE_DBG_FATAL = 0x200,<br /><br />TRACE_DBG_CRITICAL = 0x400<br />};<br /><br />You can also enable full Verbose logging but note that this affects performance. If you need this for a limited time do the following:<br /><br />1.  In the registry, at HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Microsoft Data Protection Manager add a DWORD value TraceLogLevel and set it to 0x43e.<br />2.  To apply immediately stop the DPM services for which you want to enable verbose logging and delete the old logs.<br />3.  After you reproduce the issue and finish troubleshooting, delete the registry entry you created and restart the stopped services so that non-verbose logging works again.|
|TraceLogPath|REG_SZ|Specifies the log location.<br /><br />Requires a valid NTFS volume path with 3 GB of compressed space on DPM server (no quotation marks required in the name for paths that contain spaces).<br /><br />Can be overridden per binary.|
|<binary> TraceLogMaxSize|DWORD|Specifies the size of the log file<br /><br />5 MB by default<br /><br />A file size (total disk space consumed for this binary's log = size * number of files to retain)|
|<binary>TraceLogMaxNum|DWORD|Maximum number of log files to retain<br /><br />30 by default<br /><br />The current number of log files is tracked in HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Microsoft Data Protection Manager: <binary>TraceLogNextNum (DWORD). This is an internal registry key and we recommend that you don't modify it.|
