# Manage telemetry settings

This article provides information about how to manage the telemetry (Diagnostics and utility data) settings in System Center â€“ Data Protection Manager (DPM).

Administrators can turn off this feature at any point of time. For detailed information about the data collected, see the [following section](#telemetry-data-collected).

## Turn on/off telemetry from console

1. In the Data Protection Manager console, go to **Management**, and click **Options** in the top pane.
