There are a number of planning steps you should take before you start deploying System Center - Virtual Machine Manager (VMM). These steps help  deployment processes go smoothly by making sure prerequisites are in place for installing and deploying VMM.

-  [Plan a VMM installation](install.md). Make sure that installation prerequisites are in place.
-  [Plan a VMM high availability deployment](~/vmm/plan-ha-install.md). You can optionally deploy the VMM management server, SQL Server database, and library server in high availability mode.
-  [Plan the VMM fabric](~/vmm/overview.md). Plan the VMM compute, networking, and storage fabrics.
