# VMM deployment scenarios

>Applies To: System Center 2016 - Virtual Machine Manager

This article provides links to System Center 2016 - Virtual Machine Manager (VMM) deployment scenarios. Deployment scenarios provide end-to-end planning and deployment steps for specific VMM topologies.

- [Deploy a VMM private cloud](../deploy-cloud.md): Private clouds provide a simple way to provision and manage on-premises resources for an organization. In VMM you can build a private cloud by provision all of its resources. You add virtual machines to the cloud, configure capacity settings, and then specify how tenants access the cloud resources.
- [Deploy a guarded fabric](../deploy-guarded-host-fabric.md): Guarded fabric helps guarantee the security of Hyper-V virtual machines. As a cloud service provider, or private cloud administrator, you can deploy a guarded fabric that typically consists of a server running the host guardian service (HGS), one or more guarded Hyper-V host servers, and a set of shielded VMs running on those hosts.
- [Deploy an SDN](../deploy-sdn.md): A Software Defined Network (SDN) infrastructure virtualizes your network to abstract physical hardware network elements such as switches and routers. Using SDN you can dynamically manage your datacenter networking to meet workload and app requirements.
