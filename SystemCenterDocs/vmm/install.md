Use this article to install the System Center - Virtual Machine Manager (VMM) management server.

## Before you start

- Review the system requirements and [planning information](plan-install.md). Learn about [system requirements](system-requirements.md)
- Make sure you have at least local admin permissions on the computer before you run the setup.
- The service account should be an administrator on the VMM server.

> [!NOTE]
> During VMM Installation, ensure that SQL Database is not part of any Availability Group.

## Run setup

> [!NOTE]
>   The service account for VMM can be:
>  - 	A local account
>  - 	A user account used for service
>  -	A group managed service account.
>  - If you are using a local account, you can’t have VMM in highly available configuration.
>  - If you are using gMSA account, the format should be *domainFQDN\gMSAAccount$*

1. Close any open programs and ensure that no restarts are pending on the computer.
2. To start the Virtual Machine Manager Setup wizard, on your installation media, right-click **setup.exe**, and then click **Run as administrator**.
3. In the main setup page, click **Install**.
4. On the **Select features to install** page, select the **VMM management server** check box, and then click **Next**. The VMM console will be automatically installed. If you're installing on a cluster node you'll be asked if you want to make the management server highly available.
5. On the **Product registration information** page, provide the appropriate information, and then click **Next**. If you do not enter a product key, VMM will be installed as an evaluation version that expires in 180 days after installation.
6. On the **Please read this license agreement** page, review the license agreement, select the **I have read, understood, and agree with the terms of the license agreement** check box, and then click **Next**.
7. On the **Diagnostic and Usage Data** page, review Microsoft's data collection policy and how to disable data collection. Then click **Next**.
8. If the **Microsoft Update** page appears, select whether you want to use Microsoft Update, and then click Next. If you've already chosen to use Microsoft Update on this computer the page won't appear.
9. On the **Diagnostic and Usage Data** page, review Microsoft's data collection policy and how to disable data collection. Then click **Next**
10. On the **Installation location** page, use the default path or type a different installation path for the VMM program files, and then click **Next**. The setup program checks the computer on which you are installing the VMM management server to ensure that the computer meets the appropriate hardware and software requirements. If the computer does not meet a prerequisite, a page that contains information about the prerequisite and how to resolve the issue appears.
11. On the **Database configuration** page,  if you're using a remote SQL instance specify the name of the computer that is running SQL Server. If you are installing the VMM management server on the same computer that is running SQL Server, then in the **Server name** box, either type the name of the computer (for example, **vmmserver01**) or type **localhost**. If the SQL Server is in a cluster, type the cluster name.
12. Don't specify a **Port** value if you don't have a remote instance of SQL Server, or if you have a remote SQL Server that uses the default port (1443).
13. Specify the SQL Server instance name and whether to use an existing or new database. You'll need an account with permissions to connect to the instance.
14. On the **Configure service account and distributed key management** page, specify the account that the VMM service will use. You can't change the identity of the VMM service account after installation. Learn more about distributed key management [here](plan-install.md#distributed-key-management).
15. Under **Distributed Key Management**, select whether to store encryption keys in Active Directory.
16. On the **Port configuration** page, use the default port number for each feature or provide a unique port number that is appropriate in your environment. You cannot change the ports that you assign during the installation of a VMM management server unless you uninstall and then reinstall the VMM management server. Also, do not configure any feature to use port 5986, because that port number is preassigned.
17. On the **Library configuration** page, select whether to create a new library share or to use an existing library share on the computer. The default library share that VMM creates is named MSSCVMMLibrary, and the folder is located at **%SYSTEMDRIVE%\ProgramData\Virtual Machine Manager Library Files**. **ProgramData** is a hidden folder, and you cannot remove it. After the VMM management server is installed, you can add library shares and library servers by using the VMM console or by using the VMM command shell.
18. On the **Installation summary** page, review your selections and then click **Install**. The **Installing features** page appears and displays the installation progress.
19. On the **Setup completed successfully** page, click **Close** to finish the installation. To open the VMM console, you can ensure that **Open the VMM console when this wizard closes** is checked, or you can click the **Virtual Machine Manager Console** icon on the desktop.

During Setup, VMM enables the following firewall rules. These rules remain in effect even if you later uninstall VMM.

-   Windows Remote Management

-   Windows Standards-Based Storage Management

> [!NOTE]
> If Setup does not finish successfully, consult the log files in the **%SYSTEMDRIVE%\ProgramData\VMMLogs** folder. **ProgramData** is a hidden folder.


## Install VMM from a command prompt

You can install VMM from a command prompt. The installation media contains .ini files for all VMM features:

- **VMServer.ini**: Settings for the VMM management server.
- **VMClient.ini**: Settings for the VMM console.
- **VMServerUninstall.ini**: Uninstallation settings for the VMM management server.

Each of these files contain key/value pairs with default values. These entries are commented out. Remove the comment symbol(#) and change the value.

1. Edit the VMServer.ini file with the options in the table below this procedure
2. After you edit open an elevated command prompt and run setup.exe with the parameters below. For example, to use a VMServer.ini file that is stored in C:\Temp with a SQL Server administrator account of contoso\SQLAdmin01 and a VMM service account of contoso\VMMadmin14, use the following command:
**setup.exe /server /i /f C:\Temp\VMServer.ini /SqlDBAdminDomain contoso /SqlDBAdminName SQLAdmin01 /SqlDBAdminPassword password123 /VmmServiceDomain contoso /VmmServiceUserName VMMadmin14 /VmmServiceUserPassword password456 /IACCEPTSCEULA**

-   File Server Remote Management

-   Windows Standards-Based Storage Management firewall rules

If there is a problem with setup completing successfully, consult the log files in the **%SYSTEMDRIVE%\ProgramData\VMMLogs** folder. **ProgramData** is a hidden folder.

### Uninstall VMM from the command line

To uninstall VMM edit the VMServerUninstall.ini file as described below.
Then run setup.exe for the uninstall. For example, to uninstall using an ini file stored in C:\Temp with an account contoso.SQLAdmin01 type: **setup.exe /server /x /f C:\Temp\VMServerUninstall.ini /SqlDBAdminDomain contoso /SqlDBAdminName SQLAdmin01 /SqlDBAdminPassword password123**

## Support for gMSA account
Group Managed Service Account (gMSA) helps improve the security posture and provides convenience  through automatic password management, simplified service principle name (SPN) management and the ability to delegate the management to other administrators.

VMM 2019 supports the use of gMSA for *Management server service account*.

>[!NOTE]
> gMSA, when used as VMM Service account, needs to have *logon as a service* and *Replace a process level token* permissions.

**Prerequisites**

1. Review [this article](/windows-server/security/group-managed-service-accounts/getting-started-with-group-managed-service-accounts) and create gMSA as per the guidance available in the article.
2. Make sure that the servers on which VMM Management service would be installed have permissions to retrieve the password of gMSA account.

> [!NOTE]
> You do not need to specify the SPN when creating the gMSA. VMM service sets the appropriate SPN on the gMSA.

**Use the following steps**

1. Start the VMM installation setup.
2. On the **Service account configuration** page, select **Group Managed Service Account** as the option for VMM service account.
3. Enter the gMSA account details in *Domain\gMSA account* format.
