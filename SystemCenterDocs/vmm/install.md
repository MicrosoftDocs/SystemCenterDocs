# Install VMM



This article describes how to install the System Center Virtual Machine Manager (VMM) management server.

## Before you start

- Review the system requirements and [planning information](plan-install.md). Learn about [system requirements](system-requirements.md).
- Ensure that you have at least local admin permissions on the computer before you run the setup.
- The service account should be an administrator on the VMM server.

>[!NOTE]
>During VMM Installation, ensure that the SQL Database isn't part of any Availability Group.

## Run setup

>[!NOTE]
>The service account for VMM can be:
> - A local account.
> - A user account used for service.
> -	A group managed service account.
> - If you're using a local account, you can't have VMM in a highly available configuration.
> - If you're using gMSA account, the format should be *domainFQDN\gMSAAccount$*.

1. Close any open programs and ensure that no restarts are pending on the computer.
2. To start the Virtual Machine Manager Setup wizard, on your installation media, right-click **setup.exe** and then select **Run as administrator**.
3. In the main setup page, select **Install**.
4. On the **Select features to install** page, </br>
     Select the **VMM management server** checkbox, and then select **Next**. 
         The VMM console installs automatically. If you're installing on a cluster node, you'll be asked if you want to make the management server highly available.
1. On the **Product registration information** page, provide the appropriate information and select **Next**. If you don't enter a product key, VMM installs as an evaluation version that expires in 180 days after installation.
1. On the **Please read this license agreement** page, </br>
     Review the license agreement, select the **I have read, understood, and agree with the terms of the license agreement** checkbox, and then select **Next**.
1. On the **Diagnostic and Usage Data** page, </br>
     Review Microsoft's data collection policy and how to disable data collection. Then select **Next**.
1. If the **Microsoft Update** page appears, </br>
     Select whether you want to use Microsoft Update, and then select **Next**. 
         If you've already chosen to use Microsoft Update on this computer, the page won't appear.
1. On the **Diagnostic and Usage Data** page, </br>
     Review Microsoft's data collection policy and how to disable data collection and then select **Next**.
1. On the **Installation location** page, </br>
     Use the default path or enter a different installation path for the VMM program files, and then select **Next**. 
         The setup program checks the computer on which you're installing the VMM management server to ensure that the computer meets the appropriate hardware and software requirements. If the computer doesn't meet a prerequisite, a page that contains information about the prerequisite and how to resolve the issue appears.
1. On the **Database configuration** page,
    - If you're using a remote SQL instance, specify the name of the computer that's running the SQL Server. 
    - If you're installing the VMM management server on the same computer that's running the SQL Server, then in the **Server name** box, either enter the name of the computer (for example, **vmmserver01**) or **localhost**. 
    - If the SQL Server is in a cluster, enter the cluster name.
1. Don't specify a **Port** value if you don't have a remote instance of the SQL Server or if you have a remote SQL Server that uses the default port (1433).
1. Specify the SQL Server instance name and whether to use an existing or new database. You need an account with permissions to connect to the instance.
1. On the **Configure service account and distributed key management** page, </br>
     Specify the account that the VMM service uses. You can't change the identity of the VMM service account after installation. Learn more about distributed key management [here](plan-install.md#distributed-key-management).
1. Under **Distributed Key Management**, select whether to store encryption keys in Active Directory or not.
1. On the **Port configuration** page, </br>
     Use the default port number for each feature or provide a unique port number that's appropriate in your environment. 
         You can't change the ports that you assign during the installation of a VMM management server unless you uninstall and then reinstall the VMM management server. Also, don't configure any feature to use port 5986 because that port number is preassigned.
1. On the **Library configuration** page, </br>
     Select whether to create a new library share or to use an existing library share on the computer. 
         The default library share that VMM creates is named *MSSCVMMLibrary*, and the folder is located at **%SYSTEMDRIVE%\ProgramData\Virtual Machine Manager Library Files**. **ProgramData** is a hidden folder, and you can't remove it. 
         After the VMM management server is installed, you can add library shares and library servers by using the VMM console or by using the VMM command shell.
1. On the **Installation summary** page, </br>
     Review your selections and then select **Install**. The **Installing features** page appears and displays the installation progress.
1. On the **Setup completed successfully** page, 
    1. Select **Close** to finish the installation. 
    1. To open the VMM console, ensure that **Open the VMM console when this wizard closes** is checked or select the **Virtual Machine Manager Console** icon on the desktop.

## Install VMM from a command prompt

You can install VMM from a command prompt. The installation media contains `.ini` files for all the VMM features:

- **VMServer.ini**: Settings for the VMM management server.
- **VMClient.ini**: Settings for the VMM console.
- **VMServerUninstall.ini**: Uninstallation settings for the VMM management server.

Each of these files contains key/value pairs with default values. These entries are commented out. Remove the comment symbol (#) and change the value.

1. Edit the `VMServer.ini` file with the options in the table below this procedure.
2. After you edit, open an elevated command prompt and run setup.exe with the following parameters. For example, to use a `VMServer.ini` file that is stored in C:\Temp with a SQL Server administrator account of *contoso\SQLAdmin01* and a VMM service account of *contoso\VMMadmin14*, use the following command:
**setup.exe /server /i /f C:\Temp\VMServer.ini /SqlDBAdminDomain contoso /SqlDBAdminName SQLAdmin01 /SqlDBAdminPassword password123 /VmmServiceDomain contoso /VmmServiceUserName VMMadmin14 /VmmServiceUserPassword password456 /IACCEPTSCEULA**

## Support for gMSA account
Group Managed Service Account (gMSA) helps improve the security posture and provides convenience  through automatic password management, simplified service principle name (SPN) management, and the ability to delegate the management to other administrators.

VMM supports the use of gMSA for *Management server service account*.

>[!NOTE]
> gMSA, when used as VMM Service account, needs to have *logon as a service* and *Replace a process level token* permissions.

**Prerequisites**

1. Review [this article](/windows-server/security/group-managed-service-accounts/getting-started-with-group-managed-service-accounts) and create gMSA as per the guidance available in the article.
2. Ensure that the servers on which VMM Management service would be installed have permissions to retrieve the password of the gMSA account.

     > [!NOTE]
     > You don't need to specify the SPN when creating the gMSA. VMM service sets the appropriate SPN on the gMSA.

**Use the following steps:**

1. Start the VMM installation setup.
2. On the **Service account configuration** page, select **Group Managed Service Account** as the option for VMM service account.
3. Enter the gMSA account details in *Domain\gMSA account* format.
