# Enable enhanced console session in VMM
This article provides information about how to configure enhanced console session in System Center - Virtual Machine Manager (VMM).

Console connect in VMM provides a way to connect to the VM without a network connection to it.  For information on deploying VMM console, see [install VMM console](install-console.md). Prior to 1801, the console connect in VMM supported only basic session where clipboard text can only be pasted through **Type Clipboard Text menu** option.

VMM 1801 and later supports enhanced console session. With console connected through enhanced session,  **Cut (Ctrl + X)**, **Copy (Ctrl + C)** and **Paste (Ctrl + V)** operations on the ANSI text and files are available on the clipboard, there by copy/paste commands for text and files are made possible from and to the VM.


## Before you start
Ensure the following prerequisites:

1.  The operating system of the host, on which the VM is running, should be Windows Server 2016 and above.
2.	The Hyper-V host must have Enhanced session mode policy setting turned ON.
3.	The computer from which you connect to the VM must run on Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows Server, Windows Server 2016 or above.
4.	The virtual machine must have remote desktop services enabled and run Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows Server 2016 or Windows Server 2012 R2 as the guest operating system.

## Procedure - enable the enhanced console session

**Use the following steps**:

1. Right-click the host in **VMs & Services** and navigate to **Enhanced Session** option.
2. Select **Allow enhanced session mode** and click **OK**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > This action will close the current session and opens a new session. You will be redirected to the login screen in the new session.

6. To switch back to basic session, click **Open Basic Session** at the top right.

   > [!NOTE]
   >  Once Enhanced Session Mode policy is enabled on the host:
   > - Close any open console sessions to view the **Enhanced Session** option.
   > - For a VM that is booting for the first-time from a VHD/VHDX, the enhanced session option doesnâ€™t show up when you attempt to connect through console. Restart the VM and refresh the VM properties in VMM for the Enhanced Session option to appear in console connect window.
