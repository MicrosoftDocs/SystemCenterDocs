# Enable enhanced console session in VMM


This article provides information on how to configure enhanced console session in System Center Virtual Machine Manager (VMM).

Console connect in VMM provides a way to connect to the VM without a network connection to it.  For information on deploying VMM console, see [install VMM console](install-console.md). In System Center 2016, the console connect in VMM supported only basic session where clipboard text can only be pasted through the **Type Clipboard Text menu** option.

From System Center 2019, VMM supports enhanced console session. With console connected through enhanced session,  **Cut (Ctrl + X)**, **Copy (Ctrl + C)**, and **Paste (Ctrl + V)** operations on the ANSI text and files are available on the clipboard, thereby copy/paste commands for text and files are made possible from and to the VM.

## Enable the enhanced console session

**Use the following steps**:

1. Right-click the host in **VMs & Services** and navigate to the **Enhanced Session** option.
2. Select **Allow enhanced session mode** and select **OK**.

3. In the VMM console, navigate to the VM on this host.
4. Right-click the VM and select **Connect via Console**.


::: moniker range="<sc-vmm-2019"

5. Once you see the VM console, look for the **Open Enhanced Session** option at the top right of the page. Select it to launch the Enhanced Session window.

   > [!NOTE]
   > This action will close the current session and open a new session. You will be redirected to the sign in screen in the new session.

Once the Enhanced Session Mode policy is enabled on the host:

- Close any open console sessions to view the **Enhanced Session** option.
- For a VM that is booting for the first time from a VHD/VHDX, the enhanced session option doesnâ€™t show up when you attempt to connect through console. Restart the VM and refresh the VM properties in VMM for the Enhanced Session option to appear in the console connect window.
