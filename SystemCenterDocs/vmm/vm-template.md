This article describes how to create VMs in the System Center - Virtual Machine Manager (VMM) fabric from a VMM virtual machine (VM) template. You can use a VM template to create standalone VMs or to create VMs in tiers in a [service template](library-service-templates.md).

## Before you start

- Some settings, including server roles and features, application installation, and SQL Server settings, apply only when a VM template is used for service deployments. For standalone virtual machine creation, these settings aren't used and won't appear when you create a standalone VM.
- The ability to configure a VM to use static IP addresses from an IP address pool managed by VMM is only available when you deploy a VM using a VM template.
- To complete the steps, you must be an administrator or delegated administrator on the VMM server or a self-service user.
- If you're a self-service user, you need **Deploy** permissions with the **Store and re-deploy** action assigned. You must first deploy the VM to a private cloud and then store it in the library.
- You can only customize static IP address settings if you create a VM from a VM template.
- You can use VMM to configure the availability settings for the virtual machine. [Learn more](vm-settings.md).

## Create a VM

1. Select **VMs and Services** > **Create Virtual Machine** >**Create Virtual Machine**.
2. In **Create Virtual Machine Wizard** > **Select Source**, select **Use an existing virtual machine, VM template, or virtual hard disk** > **Browse**.
3. In **Select Virtual Machine Source**, select the template > **OK**. Select **OK** if a message appears that some deployment settings will be ignored.
4. In **Select Source**, select **Next**.
5. In **Identity**, specify the VM name and an optional description. Then select **Next**.
6. In **Configure Hardware** page, either select the profile that you want to use from the **Hardware profile** list, or configure the hardware settings manually. The hardware setting displayed will differ depending on whether you're deploying a generation 1 or generation 2 machine. Then select **Next**.

    -   In **Compatibility**, if you want to deploy the virtual machine to a private cloud, select a capability profile that is available to the private cloud.
    -   In **Network Adapters**:
        - If you want to use static IP addresses, set the MAC address to static.
        - If the VM uses a VHD in VMware .vmdk format, include a legacy network adapter in the template (**New** > **Network Adapter** > **Legacy Network Adapter**. If you don't, the VM might not be able to start in a domain, although it's OK in a workgroup.
    -   In **Configure Operating System**, specify the guest operating system settings. If you have an existing profile, select in the **Guest OS profile** list.

7.  In the **Select Destination** page, specify how the virtual machine should be deployed - in a private cloud, on a host, or stored in the library.



## Deploy the VM in a private cloud

1.  In **Select Cloud**, select the private cloud on which you want to place the virtual machine. If you're connected as an Administrator, you can select the host on which the virtual machine should be deployed in the private cloud. Cloud suggestions are based on a 0-5 star rating. [Learn more](provision-vms.md#vm-placement). Verify the settings and modify if required:

    -   **Expected utilization**: Expected utilization for a VM created from a blank VHD is based on standard defaults. VMM updates host suggestions and ratings in response to modifications made to the expected virtual machine utilization.
    -   **Make this VM highly available**: With this option selected, only hosts that are located in a cluster are available for selection.
    -   **Details**: Indicates the status of the host, the operating system, and the type and status of the virtualization software.
    -   **Rating Explanation**: Provides an explanation if a host received a zero rating.
    -   **SAN Explanation** or **Deployment and Transfer Explanation**: Lists any factors that make a storage area network (SAN) transfer unavailable. VMM doesn't recognize a virtual machine that is stored on a SAN as available for deployment by using SAN transfer if the virtual machine was stored directly in the library when it was created or was added to the library during a library refresh. To avoid this issue, deploy the virtual machine to a host by using a LAN transfer, and then store the virtual machine in the same VMM library, library share, and logical unit number (LUN).
    - The **Deployment and Transfer Explanation** tab provides an explanation if fast file copy can't be used. Fast file copy is based on the Windows Offloaded Data Transfers (ODX). [Learn more](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-R2-and-2012/hh831628(v=ws.11)).

2.  In **Configure Settings**, review the VM settings. Either accept the default VM path on the host or specify a different location. You can optionally select to **Add this path to the list of default virtual machine paths on the host**. In **Machine Resources**, accept the default values for the VHD or modify as required. To prevent placement from choosing its own values, select the pin icon next to the setting. This option isn't available for self-service users.
3.  In **Select Networks**, if it appears, optionally select the network settings, and select **Next**.
4.  In **Add Properties**, configure the action to take when the host starts or stops and the operating system that you'll install on the VM. Then select **Next.**
5.  In **Summary**, confirm the settings, and select **Create**. Confirm that the VM was created in **VMs and Services** > **Clouds**, and select the cloud. The virtual machine appears in the **VMs** pane.

## Deploy the VM on a host

1. In **Select Host**, view the ratings, select the host on which you want to deploy the VM, and select **Next**. The host suggestions are based on a 0-5 star rating. [Learn more](provision-vms.md#vm-placement). Verify the settings and modify if required:

    -   **Expected utilization**: Expected utilization for a VM created from a blank VHD is based on standard defaults. VMM updates host suggestions and ratings in response to modifications made to the expected virtual machine utilization.
    -   **Make this VM highly available**: With this option selected, only hosts that are located in a cluster are available for selection.
    -   **Details**: Indicates the status of the host, the operating system, and the type and status of the virtualization software.
    -   **Rating Explanation**: Provides an explanation if a host received a zero rating.
    -   **SAN Explanation** or **Deployment and Transfer Explanation**: Lists any factors that make a storage area network (SAN) transfer unavailable. VMM doesn't recognize a virtual machine that is stored on a SAN as available for deployment by using SAN transfer if the virtual machine was stored directly in the library when it was created or was added to the library during a library refresh. To avoid this issue, deploy the virtual machine to a host by using a LAN transfer, and then store the virtual machine in the same VMM library, library share, and logical unit number (LUN).
    - The **Deployment and Transfer Explanation** tab provides an explanation if fast file copy can't be used. Fast file copy is based on the Windows Offloaded Data Transfers (ODX). [Learn more](/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-R2-and-2012/hh831628(v=ws.11)).
2.  In **Configure Settings**, review the VM settings. Either accept the default VM path on the host or specify a different location. You can optionally select to **Add this path to the list of default virtual machine paths on the host**. In **Machine Resources**, accept the default values for the VHD or modify as required. To prevent placement from choosing its own values, select the pin icon next to the setting. This option isn't available for self-service users.
3. In **Select Networks**, if it appears, optionally select the network settings, and select **Next**.
4. In **Add Properties**, configure the action to take when the host starts or stops, and the operating system that you'll install on the VM. Then select **Next.**
5.  On the **Summary** page, confirm the settings, and then select **Create**.


## Store the VM in the library

1.  In **Select Library Server**, select the library server that you want to use, and then select **Next**.
2.  In **Select Path**, specify the library share location to store the virtual machine. Select **Browse** to select a library share and an optional folder location, select **OK**, and then select **Next**.
3.  In **Summary**, confirm the settings and then select **Create**.
4.  To confirm that the virtual machine was created, in the **Library** workspace, in the **Library** pane, expand **Library Servers**, expand the library server where you stored the virtual machine, and then select **Stored Virtual Machines and Services**. The stored virtual machine appears in the **Physical Library Objects** pane.
