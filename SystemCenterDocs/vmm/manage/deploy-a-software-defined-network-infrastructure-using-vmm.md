# Deploy a Software Defined Network infrastructure using VMM

>Applies To: System Center 2016 Technical Preview - Virtual Machine Manager

System Center Virtual Machine Manager (VMM) can be used to deploy a Software Defined Network (SDN) infrastructure. The SDN infrastructure includes a network controller, a software load balancer, and a RAS gateway.

If you do not already have VMM deployed on your network, you will need to deploy it first. For more information, see [Deploying System Center 2016 - Virtual Machine Manager](..\Deploy\Deploying-System-Center-2016---Virtual-Machine-Manager.md).

Use the following guides to deploy your SDN infrastructure:

* [Deploy a Network Controller using VMM](Deploy-a-Network-Controller-using-VMM.md)
* [Deploy a Software Load Balancer using VMM](Deploy-a-Software-Load-Balancer-using-VMM.md)
* [Deploy a RAS Gateway using VMM](Deploy-a-RAS-Gateway-using-VMM.md)

> [!NOTE]
> You can also deploy an SDN infrastructure using scripts. For more information, see [Deploy a Software Defined Network infrastructure using scripts](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt427380(v=ws.12).aspx).
