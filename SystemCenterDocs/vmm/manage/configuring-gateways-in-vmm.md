# Configuring gateways in VMM

>Applies To: System Center 2016 Technical Preview - Virtual Machine Manager

Use a gateway in Virtual Machine Manager (VMM) to connect a VM network to other networks. (To use this configuration, you must configure the logical network underlying the VM network to use network virtualization.) When you configure the VM network to use a gateway, you can specify an option for network address translation (NAT), or an option for a virtual private network (VPN) tunnel, with or without Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).
