# How to deploy a virtual machine by converting a physical computer (P2V)
In VMM in System Center 2016 Technical Preview, you can't perform P2V conversions. Instead, use the Microsoft Virtual Machine Converter (MVMC). For more information, see [Microsoft Virtual Machine Converter 3.0](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn873998.aspx).
