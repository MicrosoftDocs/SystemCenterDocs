# Manage telemetry settings in VMM

This article provides information about how to turn on/off the telemetry settings in System Center Virtual Machine Manager (VMM).

> [!NOTE]
> Microsoft does not collect any personal data from the customers. We only listen to events that would help diagnostics in VMM. [Learn more](#telemetry-data-collected)


## Turn on/off telemetry in VMM
Use the following procedure:
1. On the VMM console, select **Settings**.

   **General** settings window appears with the available list of settings.
2. Select **Diagnostics and Usage Data Settings**.

   ![Screenshot of Diagnostics and Usage.](./media/telemetry/diagnostics-and-usage-data.png)

   Page with **Do you want to send Diagnostics and Usage Data to Microsoft** message appears with an option to select either Yes or No.

   > [!NOTE]
   > We recommend you to go through the privacy statement provided on this page before making a selection.

3. To turn on telemetry, select **Yes, I am willing to send data to Microsoft**.

4. To turn off telemetry, select **No, I prefer not to send data to Microsoft**.
