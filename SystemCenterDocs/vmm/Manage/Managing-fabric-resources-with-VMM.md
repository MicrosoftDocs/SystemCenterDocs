# Managing fabric resources with VMM
Read this section to learn about deploying and using the Virtual Machine Manager \(VMM\) fabric.

The VMM fabric is an abstracted collection of resources that can be discovered, identified, and managed.  There are three main resource groups in the fabric - compute (server), network, and storage.

-   **Compute**: Resources in the compute (server) group include infrastructure services such as  pre-boot execution environment (PXE) servers to handle bare-metal deployment of Hyper-V host servers, update servers (WSUS), and virtualization hosts and clusters (Hyper-V, VMware, Citrix)
-   **Network**: Network resources including VMM networks, load balancers, and gateways.
-   **Storage**: Storage resources including storage arrays, file servers, and storage pools.

After the fabric is in place you can use it to deploy virtual machines (VMs) and services in VMM private clouds. 

You can locate information about the specific areas for managing the fabric in the following areas:
