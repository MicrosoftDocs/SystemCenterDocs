# Managing private clouds with VMM

>Applies To: System Center 2016 Technical Preview - Virtual Machine Manager




A private cloud is a cloud that is provisioned and managed on-premises by an organization. The private cloud is deployed by using an organizationï¿½s own hardware to leverage the advantages of the private cloud model. By using Virtual Machine Manager (VMM), an organization can manage the private cloud definition and can manage access to the private cloud and the underlying physical resources. This section provides an overview of a private cloud architecture, and procedures for creating a private cloud from one or more host groups or from a VMware resource pool in VMM.
