# Creating profiles and templates in VMM
[!INCLUDE[vmm12sp1_long](../../includes/vmm12sp1_long_md.md)] profiles contain configuration settings that you can apply to a new virtual machine template or virtual machine. You can create, view, and modify profiles in the **Library** workspace. 


> [!NOTE]
> [!INCLUDE[vmm12short](../../includes/vmm12short_md.md)] also includes physical computer profiles. These profiles are not used for virtual machine creation. They are used for provisioning Hyper\-V hosts, host clusters, or Scale\-Out File Server clusters from bare metal.
