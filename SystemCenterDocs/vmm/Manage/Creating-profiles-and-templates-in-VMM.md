# Creating profiles and templates in VMM
Virtual Machine Manager (VMM) profiles contain configuration settings that you can apply to a new virtual machine template or virtual machine. You can create, view, and modify profiles in the **Library** workspace. 


> [!NOTE]
> VMM also includes physical computer profiles. These profiles are not used for virtual machine creation. They are used for provisioning Hyper-V hosts, host clusters, or Scale-Out File Server clusters from bare metal.
