# Deploying Scale-Out File Servers from bare metal with VMM
The procedures in this section describe how to use Virtual Machine Manager (VMM) to discover physical computers on the network, automatically install an operating system, and provision the computers into a Scale-Out File Server.

For information about other approaches to deploying a Scale-Out File Server, see [Managing Scale-Out File Servers with VMM](Managing-Scale-Out-File-Servers-with-VMM.md).
