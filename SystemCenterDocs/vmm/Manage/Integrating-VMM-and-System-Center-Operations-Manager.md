# Integrating VMM and System Center Operations Manager
You can connect Virtual Machine Manager (VMM) with Operations Manager to monitor the health and availability of the virtual machines and virtual machine hosts that VMM manages. You can also monitor health and availability of the VMM management server, the VMM database server, and library servers, and see diagram views of the virtualized environment through the Operations console in Operations Manager.

For information about the versions of Operations Manager that VMM supports, see [Preparing your environment for System Center 2016 - Virtual Machine Manager](../Deploy/Preparing-your-environment-for-System-Center-2016---Virtual-Machine-Manager.md).

When you integrate VMM with Operations Manager, the monitoring pack for VMM is automatically imported into Operations Manager, and in addition, the following features become available:

-   Performance and Resource Optimization (PRO)

-   Maintenance Mode integration

-   Support for SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) and the reporting capabilities provided by SSAS
