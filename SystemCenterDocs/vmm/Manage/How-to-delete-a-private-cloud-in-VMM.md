# How to delete a private cloud in VMM
You can use this procedure to delete a private cloud in Virtual Machine Manager \(VMM\).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before you can delete a private cloud, there must be no objects that reference the private cloud, such as services, service deployment configurations, and deployed or stored virtual machines.

### To delete a private cloud

1.  Open the **VMs and Services** workspace.

2.  In the **VMs and Services** pane, expand **Clouds**. Locate and then click the private cloud that you want to delete.

3.  In the **VMs** pane, verify that there are no objects related to that cloud.

4.  On the **Folder** tab, click **Delete**.

5.  When you are prompted whether you want to remove the private cloud, click **Yes**.

    Open the **Jobs** workspace to view the job status.
