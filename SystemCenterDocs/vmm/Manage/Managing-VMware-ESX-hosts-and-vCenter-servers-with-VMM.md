# Managing VMware ESX hosts and vCenter servers with VMM

>Applies To: System Center 2016 Technical Preview - Virtual Machine Manager

Virtual Machine Manager (VMM) provides a common user interface and common command-line interface (CLI) for managing resources from multiple hypervisors and making those resources available
  to private cloud deployments.

VMM integrates directly 
  with VMware vCenter Server, 
    so you can use the VMM console to manage day-to-day operations of VMware hosts, host clusters, and virtual machines. You can use VMM to create, store, deploy, and manage virtual machines and services on VMware ESX and ESXi hosts, as well as to discover and manage hosts. VMM also recognizes and supports more advanced fabric management features that you can configure through vCenter Server, such as port groups, standard and distributed virtual switches (or vSwitches), vMotion, and Storage vMotion.
