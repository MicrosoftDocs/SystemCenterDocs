# Using infrastructure servers in VMM
You can add infrastructure servers to Virtual Machine Manager (VMM), that is, servers that support services such as Active Directory, DNS, DHCP, Operations Manager, Service Manager, and so on. In VMM, these servers are listed under the role of **Infrastructure**. Adding infrastructure servers can make it easier to keep them updated.

> [!NOTE]
> All infrastructure servers in VMM must run Windows Server 2012 R2 or Windows Server Technical Preview.

You can perform the following procedures on infrastructure servers:

-   Create baselines for infrastructure nodes using existing VMM baseline tools and processes.

-   Apply baselines to all infrastructure nodes once they are added as managed computers.

-   View compliance status of infrastructure nodes after baselines have been applied.

-   Orchestrate remediation to the infrastructure nodes using existing baseline tools and procedures.

## In This Section
Follow these procedures to when using infrastructure servers in VMM.
