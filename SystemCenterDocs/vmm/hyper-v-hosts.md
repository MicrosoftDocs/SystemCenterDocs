# Manage Hyper-V hosts and clusters in the VMM compute fabric

>Applies To: System Center 2016 - Virtual Machine Manager

Read this article to learn how set up and manage Hyper-V hosts and clusters in the System Center 2016 - Virtual Machine Manager (VMM) compute fabric.

You can manage medium, large, and enterprise-scale Hyper-V deployments in the VMM fabric. VMM provides a number of features that allow you to manage and scale growing numbers of Hyper-V servers more easily than in Hyper-V Manager.

In the VMM fabric you can:

- [Perform rolling upgrades](hyper-v-rolling-upgrade.md) of Hyper-V clusters in the VMM fabric.
- [Add existing Windows servers and clusters](hyper-v-existing.md) with or without the Hyper-V role to the VMM fabric.
- [Add a Nano server](manage/manage-compute-add-nano-hyper-v.md) as a Hyper-V host or cluster in the VMM fabric.
- [Create a Hyper-V cluster](manage/manage-compute-create-cluster-from-standalone.md) from existing standalone Hyper-V hosts in the VMM fabric.
- [Provision a Hyper-V host or cluster from bare metal](manage/manage-compute-bare-metal-hyper-v.md) in the VMM fabric.
