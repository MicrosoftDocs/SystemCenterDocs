# About Arc-enabled System Center Virtual Machine Manager

Azure Arc-enabled System Center Virtual Machine Manager (SCVMM) empowers System Center customers to connect their VMM environment to Azure and perform VM self-service operations from Azure portal. With Azure Arc-enabled SCVMM, you get consistent management experience across Azure. 

Azure Arc-enabled System Center Virtual Machine Manager allows you to manage your Hybrid environment and perform self-service VM operations through Azure portal. For Microsoft Azure Pack customers, this solution is intended as an alternative to perform VM self-service operations. 

Arc-enabled System Center VMM allows you to: 

- Perform various VM lifecycle operations such as start, stop, pause, delete VMs on VMM managed VMs directly from Azure. 

- Empower developers and application teams to self-serve VM operations on-demand using [Azure role-based access control (RBAC)](/azure/role-based-access-control/overview).

- Browse your VMM resources (VMs, templates, VM networks, and storage) in Azure, providing you with a single pane view for your infrastructure across both environments. 

- Discover and onboard existing SCVMM managed VMs to Azure.
