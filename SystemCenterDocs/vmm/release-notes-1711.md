# VMM 1711 release notes (Technical preview)

This articles summarizes the release notes for System Center Virtual Machine Manager preview 1711 ( VMM 1711).

## VM Template created from Windows Server 1709 VM resets the Operating System incorrectly to Windows Server 2012 R2

**Description** : A VM template, created from Windows Server 1709 VM that is correctly marked as Windows Server Datacenter version 1709” in VMM, will have operating system labeled incorrectly to “Windows Server 2012 R2 Standard “.

**Workaround**: Change the OS to “Windows Server Datacenter version 1709” in the template and save.


## VM migration to an unguarded Windows Server 1709 host might fail

**Description**:  Migration to a Windows Server 1709 host that has attestation status set to Local might fail. This is because of the numerous certificates generated by the host on periodic call to **Get-HGSClientConfiguration** by VMM. The operation to migrate the VM to this host will timeout as the platform tries to validate each and every certificate in the local store.

**Workaround**: Delete the certificates from local store at regular intervals.
