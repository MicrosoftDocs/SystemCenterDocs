# Identify VMM ports and protocols

As part of your System Center Virtual Machine Manager (VMM) deployment, you need to allow access for the ports, and protocols that the VMM server and components will use. It's important to plan this in advance. Some of the port settings are configured in VMM setup, and if you want to modify them after you set up VMM for the first time, you'll need to reinstall to do so.

## Set up exceptions

1. Identify where you need to create firewall exceptions, in accordance with the table below.
2. On the server you identify, select **Start** > **Next** > **Administrative Tools** > **Windows Firewall with Advanced Security**.
2. In the **Windows Firewall with Advanced Security on Local Computer** pane, select on **Inbound Rules**.
3. In **Actions**, select **New Rule**.
4. In the **New Inbound Rule Wizard** > **Rule Type**, select **Port**, and then select **Next**.
5. In **Protocol and Ports**, specify the port settings in accordance with the table below and continue in the wizard to create the rule.

## Port and protocol exceptions

**Connect** |  **Port/protocol** | **Details** | **Configure**

> [!NOTE]
> In addition to the above ports, VMM relies on the default dynamic port range for all its communication with Hyper-V hosts, file servers, and library servers.  [Learn more](https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/929851/the-default-dynamic-port-range-for-tcp-ip-has-changed-in-windows-vista) about the dynamic port range.
>We recommend that you reconfigure the firewalls to allow traffic between servers in the dynamic port range of 49152 through 65535.

::: moniker range=">= sc-vmm-2019 <= sc-vmm-2022"

> [!NOTE]
> System Center Virtual Machine Manager uses NTLM authentication protocol to perform management operations.
> Using Kerberos authentication protocol isnâ€™t recommended as it may break a few VM operations.

## Next steps

You can modify some of these ports and protocols during [VMM installation](install.md).
