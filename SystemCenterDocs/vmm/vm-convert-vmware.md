# Convert a VMware VM to Hyper-V in the VMM fabric

This article describes how to convert VMware VMs in the System Center - Virtual Machine Manager (VMM) fabric to Hyper-V.

::: moniker range=">=sc-vmm-2019"

You can convert the VMs using the *Convert Virtual Machine* wizard. You can use this wizard from the VMM console.

VMM 2019 UR3 supports conversion of VMware VMs to Hyper-V and Azure Stack HCI 20H2. [Learn more about support to Azure Stack HCI 20H2](deploy-manage-azure-stack-hci.md).

There are currently a couple of methods for converting VMware VMs to Hyper-V:

- **Convert Virtual Machine Wizard**: You can use this wizard from the VMM console.

    >- See [system requirements](system-requirements.md) for supported versions of vSphere (ESXi).
    >- You can't convert VMware workstations.
    >- You can't convert VMs with virtual hard disks connected to an IDE bus.

    >- Online conversions aren't supported. You need to power off the VMware VMs.
    >- VMware tools must be uninstalled from the guest operating system of the VM.

- [**Microsoft Virtual Machine Converter**](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/system-center-blog/microsoft-virtual-machine-converter-3-0-is-now-available-for/ba-p/349874): This standalone tool converts VMware VMs to Hyper-V hosts or Azure VMs. It also converts physical machines and disks to Hyper-V hosts.

## Convert using the wizard

1. Select **VMs and Services** > **Home** > **Create** > **Create Virtual Machines** > **Convert Virtual Machine**.
2. In **Convert Virtual Machine** wizard > **Select Source**, select **Browse** and in **Select Virtual Machine Source**, select the VMware VMs you want to convert.
3. In **Specify Virtual Machine Identity**, modify the machine name and description as required.
4. In **Virtual Machine Configuration**, specify the number of processors and memory settings.
5. In **Select Host**, select a Hyper-V host/Azure Stack HCI (applicable from VMM 2019 UR3 and later) for placement. In **Select Path**, configure the storage location on the host for the VM files. The default VM paths are listed.
6. In **Select Networks**, select the logical network, virtual network, and the VLAN as applicable.
7. In **Add Properties**, configure the required settings. In **Summary**, review the settings, and select **Start the virtual machine after deploying it** if necessary.
8. Select **Create** to start the conversion.
   Verify the VM's conversion in **VMs and Services** > **Home** > **Show** > **VMs**.

## Convert EFI-based VM to Hyper-V generation 2 VM
System Center VMM enables the migration of EFI-based VMware VMs to Hyper-V. VMware VMs that you migrate to Microsoft Hyper-V platform can now take advantage of generation 2 features.

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range=">sc-vmm-2016 <=sc-vmm-2019"

As part of VMM 1801 release, the **Convert Virtual Machine** wizard enables this migration. Based on the firmware type (BIOS or EFI), the wizard selects and defaults the Hyper-V VM generation appropriately.

The **Convert Virtual Machine** wizard enables this migration. Based on the firmware type (BIOS or EFI), the wizard selects and defaults the Hyper-V VM generation appropriately.

::: moniker-end

::: moniker range=">sc-vmm-2016"

- BIOS-based VMs are migrated to Hyper-V VM Generation 1.
- EFI-based VMs are migrated to Hyper-V VM Generation 2.

### Before you start
Ensure the following prerequisites are met:

- VMware VMs with firmware type as EFI
- VMware ESXi Hosts added in System Center VMM

### Conversion procedure
1. To convert, follow the [above procedure](#convert-using-the-wizard) and select **Generation 2** in step 4.

2. Once the VM is converted, you can see the Generation 2 VM as shown in the image below:

> [!NOTE]
> - Disk conversion (from **vmdk** to **VHDX/VHD**) is enhanced to be ~50% faster than earlier.
> - PowerShell commands allow you to provide the disk type for the target Hyper-V VM, which will enable the VMware thick provisioned disk to be migrated as Hyper-V dynamic disk or vice versa, based on the requirements.

## Convert using PowerShell cmdlets

Here are the sample cmdlets:

```powershell
