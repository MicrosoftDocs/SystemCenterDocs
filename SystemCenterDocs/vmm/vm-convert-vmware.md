# Convert a VMware VM to Hyper-V in the VMM fabric

This article describes how to convert VMware VMs in the System Center - Virtual Machine Manager (VMM) fabric, to Hyper-V.


There are currently a couple of methods for converting VMWare VMs to Hyper-V:

- **Convert Virtual Machine Wizard**: In the VMM console you can use this wizard. This method has a number of limitations:
- Support for vSphere (ESXi) 4.1, 5.0, 5.1, 5.5, 6.0
- You can't convert VMware workstations
- You can't convert VMs with virtual hard disks connected to an IDE bus
- Online conversions aren't supported. You need to power off the VMware VMs.
- Anti-virus apps must be supported.
- VMware tools must be uninstalled from the guest operating system of the VM.
- [Microsoft Virtual Machine Converter](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn873998.aspx): This standalone tool converts VMware VMs to Hyper-V hosts or Azure VMs. It also converts physical machines and disks to Hyper-V hosts. IMPORTANT: This tool is in the process of retirement. It won't be available after June 3, 2017.

- Azure Site Recovery currently doesn't have to ability for a direct VMware to Hyper-V conversion. [Read more](https://feedback.azure.com/forums/256299-site-recovery/suggestions/10050060-asr-to-support-vmware-to-hyper-v-protection-migrat) about up-voting this solution.

## Convert using the wizard

1. Click **VMs and Services** > **Home** > **Create** > **Create Virtual Machines** > **Convert Virtual Machine**.
2. In **Convert Virtual Machine Wizard** > **Select Source** click **Browse** and inS**Select Virtual Machine Source** select the VMware VMs you want to convert.
3. In **Specify Virtual Machine Identity** modify the machine name and description as required.
4. In **Virtual Machine Configuration** specify the number of processor and memory settings.
5. In **Select Host** select a Hyper-V host for placement. In **Select Path** configure the storage location on the host for the VM files. The default VM paths are listed.
6. In **Select Networks** select the logical network, virtual network, and the VLAN as applicable. The list matches whatever is configured on the physical adapters of the host.
7. In **Add Properties** configure settings. In **Summary** review the settings and select **Start the virtual machine after deploying it** if required. Then click **Create** to start the conversion. Verify the VM was converted in **VMs and Services** > **Home** > **Show** > **VMs**.

## Convert  EFI based VM to Hyper-V generation 2 VM
System Center VMM enables migration of EFI based VMware VMs to Hyper-V. VMware VMs that you migrate to Microsoft Hyper-V platform can now take the advantage of generation 2 features.

As part of VMM 1801 release, the **Convert Virtual Machine** wizard enabled this migration, based on the firmware type (BIOS or EFI), selects and defaults the Hyper-V VM generation appropriately.

- BIOS-based VMs are migrated to Hyper-V VM Generation 1.
- EFI-based VMs are migrated to Hyper-V VM Generation 2.

### Before you start
Ensure the following prerequisites are met:
1.	VMware VMs with firmware type as EFI
2.	VMware ESXi Hosts added in System Center VMM

### Conversion procedure
1. To convert, follow the [above procedure](#convert-using-the-wizard), select **Generation 2** in step 4.

2. Once the VM is converted, you can see the Generation 2 VM as shown in the following image:

> [!NOTE]
> - Disk conversion (from “vmdk” to “VHDX/VHD”) is enhanced to be ~50% faster than earlier.
  - PowerShell commands allow the user to provide the disk type for the target Hyper-V VM, which will enable the VMware thick provisioned disk to be migrated as Hyper-V dynamic disk or vice versa, based upon the requirements.

## PowerShell commands

Here are the sample commands:

```powershell

New-SCV2V -VMHost <Host> -VMXPath <string> [-EnableVMNetworkOptimization <bool>] [-EnableMACAddressSpoofing
<bool>] [-VMMServer <ServerConnection>] [-LibraryServer <LibraryServer>] [-JobGroup <guid>] [-Trigger] [-VhdType
