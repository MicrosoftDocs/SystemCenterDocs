# Architecture of Service Management Automation
The following diagram illustrates each of the [!INCLUDE[sma_1](Token/sma_1_md.md)] features and the communication between them.

-   The [!INCLUDE[sma_1](Token/sma_1_md.md)] web service communicates with [!INCLUDE[katal_2](Token/katal_2_md.md)] and authenticates users.

-   The SQLÂ Server databases store and retrieve runbooks, runbook assets, activities, integration modules, and runbook job information.

-   Runbook workers run the runbooks, and they can be used for load balancing.

-   The management portal in [!INCLUDE[katal_2](Token/katal_2_md.md)] is where you author, debug, and start and stop runbooks.
