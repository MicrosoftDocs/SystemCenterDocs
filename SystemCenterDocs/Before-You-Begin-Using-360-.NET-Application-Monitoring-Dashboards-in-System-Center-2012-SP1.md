Before you begin using 360 .NET Application Monitoring Dashboards, you must configure application monitoring for the applications you want to monitor.

## Configure Application Monitoring
Before you begin using 360 .NET Application Monitoring Dashboards, you must configure .NET Application Performance Monitoring, Web Application Availability Monitoring, and Global Service Monitor for the applications you want to monitor. For more information, see:

-   [.NET Application Performance Monitoring Template](./.NET-Application-Performance-Monitoring-Template.md)

-   [Web Application Availability Monitoring Template](./Web-Application-Availability-Monitoring-Template.md)

-   Global Service Monitor documentation is on Connect. To get the documentation and get started, go to [http:\/\/connect.microsoft.com](http://connect.microsoft.com) and download **[!INCLUDE[gsmshort](./Token/gsmshort_md.md)] Installer** \(Windows Installer\).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Before configuring the 360 .NET Application Monitoring Dashboards, make sure to allow enough time for all of the applications you want to monitor to be discovered.
