# How to Delete a Service Offering or a Request Offering
Service offerings and their request offerings are available to [!INCLUDE[smssp](./Token/smssp_md.md)] users, when the status of the offering is set to Published and if end users have been assigned a corresponding [!INCLUDE[smshort](./Token/smshort_md.md)] user role. Only users who have been assigned a user role associated with a catalog group that contains catalog items can use the [!INCLUDE[smssp](./Token/smssp_md.md)] to access the service catalog. You can also delete a catalog item when it is no longer needed.
