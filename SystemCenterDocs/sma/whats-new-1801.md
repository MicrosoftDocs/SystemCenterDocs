# What's new in System Center Service Management Automation 1801

This release of System Center Service Management Automation (SMA) contains all the bug fixes shipped until the [Update Rollup 1 of SMA 2016](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/3190604), along with added support for TLS 1.2 Protocol. [Read this article](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4051111/tls-1-2-protocol-support-deployment-guide-for-system-center-2016) for more information about how to set up, configure, and run your environment to use TLS 1.2.

This build should be used for validating the SMA integration scenarios with other System Center components included in the 1801 release.
