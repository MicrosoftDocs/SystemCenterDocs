# Set or change the Service Management Automation endpoint

>Applies To: Windows Azure Pack for Windows Server

The **QuickStart** tab for Automation in Windows Azure Pack for Windows Server provides a link that enables you to set up or change the Service Management Automation endpoint. If the Service Management Automation endpoint is not yet registered, click **Register the Service Management Automation endpoint** to configure it. To change the Service Management Automation endpoint settings after an endpoint has been set up, click **Current Service Management Automation endpoint**.

The Service Management Automation endpoint requires the following information:

-   The service URL and port. The port number is set when you install Service Management Automation.

-   The user name of a user account that can access the Service Management Automation web service. Accounts with access to the Service Management Automation web service are also set during installation.

-   The access password for the user account.
