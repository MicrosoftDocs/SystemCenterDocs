# Using Event View to Investigate Problems
In [!INCLUDE[om12long](./Token/om12long_md.md)], you can use an event view for an alert to help you investigate the problem that caused the alert.

Right\-click an alert, point to **Open**, and click **Event View**. In the **Event View** window, you see information about the events associated with the alert.

In the **Details** pane, click **Generating Rule** to view information about the rule that generated the alert. The **General** tab shows you the name, description, and the source management pack of the rule.
