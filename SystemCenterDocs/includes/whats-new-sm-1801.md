## What's new in System Center 1801 - Service Manager
The following sections summarize the new features released in SM 1801.

## Support to enhanced evaluation experience

SM 1801 supports an enhanced experience for evaluating Service Manager and activating the product for retail use.  

The evaluation version of Service Manager can be installed and used for 180 days. In SM 2016, after an evaluation version is installed, there was no option to view the remaining days for the evaluation period. In Service Manager 1801, you can view the information about the evaluation period, and accordingly activate your SM. [Learn more](../scsm/sm-license.md)

## Bug fixes

This release of System Center Service Manager (SCSM) contains all the bug fixes shipped until the [Update Rollup 4 of SCSM 2016](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4024038), along with added support for TLS 1.2 Protocol. [Read this article](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4051111/tls-1-2-protocol-support-deployment-guide-for-system-center-2016) for more information about how to set up, configure, and run your environment to use TLS 1.2.

This build should be used for validating the SCSM integration scenarios with other System Center components included in release 1801.
