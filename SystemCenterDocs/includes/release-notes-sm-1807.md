## Known issues and workarounds

### Inconsistent formats for time in some areas
**Description:**
The time format in some views, such as Workitems/IncidentManagement/All Incident, is not consistent with the system local settings. This behavior might occur when you work with the views in unsealed Management Packs (MP).

**Workaround:**
To resolve this issue, follow the steps:

1.	Export the Service Manager Incident Management Configuration Library management pack.
2.	Modify the management pack. Locate the **LastModified** column and modify the binding as shown below:

**Before modification**
<mux:Column Name="lastModified" DisplayMemberBinding="{Binding Path=$LastModified$, Mode=OneWay}" Width="150" DisplayName="Header_Last_Modified" Property="$LastModified$" DataType="s:DateTime" />

**After modification**
<mux:Column Name="lastModified" DisplayMemberBinding="{datebinding:DateBinding Path=$LastModified$, Mode=OneWay}" Width="150" DisplayName="Header_Last_Modified" Property="$LastModified$" DataType="s:DateTime" />

1.	Repeat steps 1â€“2 for columns that are named **LastModified**.
2.	Re-import the modified management pack.
3.	Restart the console.
