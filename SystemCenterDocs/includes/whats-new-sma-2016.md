## What's new in SMA 2016

SMA 2016 added the following features.

## Support for PowerShell script

SMA 2016 supports PowerShell Script in addition to PowerShell Workflow, which was the only runbook format supported in the previous versions.

## PowerShell ISE add-on

The SMA PowerShell ISE add-on makes it easier to author and test your runbooks in your local PowerShell ISE environment. [Learn more](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/orchestrator/2016/04/28/introducing-service-management-automation-ise-add-on/).

## Specify a runbook worker

By default, SMA randomly picks a Runbook worker to service a job when a Runbook is invoked. SMA 2016 adds a property to a runbook that specifies a particular runbook worker on which it should run.

## Support for PowerShell 5.0

SMA 2016 supports Windows Management Framework 5.0.

### PowerShell ISE add-on v1.1

- You can now designate runbook worker for runbooks from ISE.
- New columns added for designated runbook and runbook type.
