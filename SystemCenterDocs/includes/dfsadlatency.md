The new configuration must be replicated to all domain controllers, and each member in the replication group must poll its closest domain controller to obtain the changes. The amount of time this takes depends on ADÂ DS replication latency and the long polling interval (60 minutes) on each member. To poll immediately for configuration changes, open a command prompt window and then type the following command once for each member of the replication group: <codeInline xmlns="http://ddue.schemas.microsoft.com/authoring/2003/5">dfsrdiag.exe PollAD /Member:DOMAIN\Server1</codeInline>.</Token>
