## Known issues and workarounds

### Manual steps to activate Data Warehouse Server

**Description**: Service Manager Data Warehouse isn't activated as part of the Management Server license activation. You must manually activate the Data Warehouse.

**Workaround**:
Follow these steps to manually activate the Data Warehouse server:  
1. Open Windows PowerShell.
2. Change directory to Installation folder/Powershell.
3. Run the following command to import PowerShell module;
   `– Import-Module .\System.Center.Service.Manager.psm1`
4. Run `Set-SCSMLicense powershell` cmdlet to activate the license.

   > [!NOTE]
   > DW server is the management server input to this command.

### SCSM doesn’t work with default SSAS mode on SQL 2017
**Description:**
System Center Service Manager 2019 requires SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) to work with Microsoft Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) cubes. With SQL 2017, the default SSAS mode is **Tabular**. Service Manager’s Management Server and Data Warehouse only work with SSAS mode **Multi-Dimensional** and not **Tabular**.

**Workaround:**
In case of fresh installation of SQL Server 2017, select the SSAS mode as **Multi-Dimensional**. In case of an upgrade from an earlier version of SQL Server to SQL Server 2017, the older SSAS mode persists. Hence, no manual step is required for SQL Server upgrade scenario.

### Installation of SM 2019 on TLS 1.2 machine fails
**Description**: Fresh Installation of System Center Service Manager 2019 or an upgrade from a previous version to SM 2019 fails if the computer is TLS 1.2 hardened.

**Workaround**: Disable TLS 1.2 before the installation/upgrade and re-enable it after the upgrade is complete.

### Prerequisite for installing SM Authoring Tool
**Description**: Install Microsoft Visual C++ 2012 Redistributable before you deploy Service Manager Authoring Tool 2019.

**Workaround**: None.

### Create Exchange Connector wizard might crash
**Description**: When you create a new Exchange Connector using Service Manager 2019 console, it gives an exception if the admin selects the **Test Connection** in the **Server Connection** pane of **Create Exchange Connector** wizard.

**Workaround**: Don't select **Test Connection** in the **Create Exchange Connector** wizard. Instead, select the **Next** button, which internally tests the connection and doesn't crash the wizard. If the crash has occurred, restart the wizard and use this workaround.

### Domain selection through Browse options fails in AD connector wizard
**Description**: An error occurs when you select **Browse** to choose the domain or OU in Active Directory connector wizard of Service Manager 2019 console.

**Workaround**: Install Microsoft Visual C++ 2012 Redistributable on the computer and use the AD connector wizard.

### Error while creating a new software type configuration item
**Description**: The property **Is Virtual Application** field in **Create Software configuration item** form is mandatory, but it doesn't carry the asterix (\*) that indicates a mandatory item.

When you don't fill this field and select **Ok** or **Apply**, an error appears and you can't use the form.

**Workaround**: Reopen the create Software configuration item form, and fill all the details including the field **Is Virtual Application**, and select **OK** or **Apply**.

### Steps to configure remote SQL Server reporting services
**Description**: During deployment of the Service Manager data warehouse management server, you can specify the server to which Microsoft SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) will be deployed. During this setup, the computer that is hosting the data warehouse management server is selected by default. If you specify a different computer to host SSRS, you're prompted to follow a procedure to prepare the server.

**Workaround**: To specify a different computer to host SSRS, perform the steps [detailed here](../scsm/config-remote-ssrs.md).

### SM console installed on a VMM Server causes VMM connector failure
**Description**: If you install Service Manager console on the same server as VMM, then you can't use that Service Manager console to create a VMM connector to that VMM server.

**Workaround**: Use a different Service Manager console to create the VMM connector.

### SM console installed on an Operations Manager management server causes an error
**Description**: You can't install the Service Manager console on an Operations Manager management server. This capability is currently not supported.

**Workaround**: None.

### Data Warehouse Setup might fail if the DB or log path has a single quote
**Description**: During setup, if you specify a database or log path that includes a single quotation mark character ('), setup might fail.

**Workaround**: Use the path without a single quotation.

### Setup might fail if the SM Authoring Tool was installed earlier
**Description**: Setup of SM Authoring tool might fail if you've previously installed any version of the Service Manager Authoring Tool.

**Workaround**: Remove the earlier version of Service Manager Authoring Tool, and then retry the setup.

### Setup does not install the Report Viewer language pack
**Description**: Setup includes a prerequisite checker that checks for and, if necessary, installs the Microsoft Report Viewer. However, Setup doesn't install the Report Viewer language pack, which makes the Microsoft Report Viewer compatible with Windows operating systems that are configured to use languages other than English.

**Workaround**: If your system is configured to use a language other than English, you should manually install the Report Viewer Language Pack for that language.

### SM Setup fails if a SQL Server instance contains a *$* character
**Description**: If you attempt to install Service Manager using a named Structured Query Language (SQL) instance that contains a dollar sign (*$*) character, setup fails.

**Workaround**: Use a SQL instance that doesn't contain the *$* character in its name.

### Orchestrator Connector Account Password cannot contain *$* characters
**Description**: If the Orchestrator connector account password contains a *$* character, the sync job completes; however, runbooks aren't updated in the Service Manager database.

**Workaround**: If your Orchestrator connector account password contains a *$* character, change the password to one that doesn't include the *$* character.

### Setup logs display in English only
**Description**: The Setup logs in Service Manager are available in English only.

**Workaround**: None.

### Errors might occur when you modify or delete Service Request template items
**Description**: When you create a service request using a request offering template and you modify or delete activities that are contained in the template, various errors might occur that prevent you from saving the service request.

**Workaround**: When you create service requests, avoid modifying or deleting activities that are contained in a request offering template. If necessary, you can create a new request offering template with only the activities that are necessary and configured properly for your intended use.

### Configuration of Reporting Server might take a longer time
**Description**: When you install the data warehouse, validation of the default web server URL might take as long as 25 seconds to complete.

**Workaround**: None.

### Double-Byte characters are sent incorrectly to search provider
**Description**: When you perform a knowledge search and you enter double-byte characters in the Search Provider box, they aren't sent correctly to the search website. Instead, erroneous characters are sent.

**Workaround**: None.

### Sorting knowledge articles by date does not work
**Description**: When you try to sort knowledge articles by date, sorting doesn't work.

**Workaround**: None.

### Inconsistent formats for time in some areas
**Description**: The time format in some views, such as Workitems/IncidentManagement/All Incident, isn't consistent with the system local settings. This issue might occur when you work with the views in unsealed management packs (MP).

**Workaround**:
To resolve this issue, follow the steps:

1. Export the Service Manager Incident Management Configuration Library management pack.

2. Modify the management pack. Locate the **LastModified** column and modify the binding as shown below:

**Before modification**

<mux:Column Name="lastModified" DisplayMemberBinding="{Binding Path=$LastModified$, Mode=OneWay}" Width="150" DisplayName="Header_Last_Modified" Property="$LastModified$" DataType="s:DateTime" />

**After modification**

<mux:Column Name="lastModified" DisplayMemberBinding="{datebinding:DateBinding Path=$LastModified$, Mode=OneWay}" Width="150" DisplayName="Header_Last_Modified" Property="$LastModified$" DataType="s:DateTime" />

1.	Repeat steps 1–2 for columns that are named **LastModified**.
2.	Reimport the modified management pack.
3.	Restart the console.


### Data Warehouse Setup might  fail, if SSRS is installed locally on the Data Warehouse Management server

**Description**: If SSRS 2017 or later is installed locally on the Data Warehouse Management server, Data Warehouse setup might fail at *Install services* phase, with the following  error:
*An error occurred while executing a custom action:_CreateSrsFolder_SC*.

This issue is observed in Service Manager 2019 with Windows 2019.

**Workaround**: After initiating the Data Warehouse setup, check if the SSRS service stops during the setup. If it stops, start the SSRS service prior to *Install services* phase.

### Report management pack deployments might fail

**Description**: After a successful Data Warehouse installation, deployments of Report management packs might fail if SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) is running locally on the Data Warehouse management Server and SSRS is 2017 or later. 

This issue is observed in Service Manager 2016 and later.

**Workaround**: Perform the steps [detailed here](/system-center/scsm/config-remote-ssrs).
