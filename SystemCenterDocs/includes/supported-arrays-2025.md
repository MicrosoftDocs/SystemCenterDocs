## Supported storage arrays in VMM 2025

 Virtualized workloads in System Center - Virtual Machine Manager (VMM) need storage resources that meet capacity and performance requirements. VMM recognizes local and remote storage. It supports storage on block-level storage devices that expose logical unit numbers (LUNs) using fiber channel, iSCSCI, and SAS connections, and network file shares.
