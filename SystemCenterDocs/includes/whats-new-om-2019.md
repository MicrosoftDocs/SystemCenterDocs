## What's New in OM 2019

The content in the following sections describes new features in System Center 2019 - Operations Manager.

## Management server failover feature for Linux/UNIX
Management server failover is a crucial feature to enable high-availability and provide fault tolerance in production environments. SCOM 2019 is enhanced for handling failover and load-balancing scenario for Linux/Unix machines and network devices.

With earlier versions of SCOM, when primary management server goes offline, the failover server closes all monitor-based alerts and reopens the same alerts. With SCOM 2019, old alerts are not closed while there is only an increment in the monitor-based alert count.

The issue of generating new tickets and new alerts whenever failover or load balancing occurs, is now fixed with SCOM 2019. For example, there are 100 active alerts on MS1, failover happens on MS2, the repeat count of these alerts will be incremented. With this change, no new alerts or tickets are generated during failover.

## Updates and Recommendation feature for Linux
**Updates and Recommendations** feature, which was available for Windows workload is now extended for Linux workloads. This feature helps you to proactively identify workloads deployed in your Linux agents that were not monitored by Operations Manager or are not monitored using the latest version of Management Pack (MP).

If there are Management Packs in the catalog that is designed to monitor those workloads, they will be displayed on the **Updates and Recommendations** screen. You will also find a list of any updates that are available for Management Packs that are installed in your management group.

A new capability, **Machine Details** allow administrators to see the agent machine name and operating system installed on it.

## Linux agent installation changes
With System Center 2019, there are changes in the Linux agent package bundling. This bundle now consists of scx and omi shell bundles only. Post agent installation, a new user called **omiuser** will be created on the agent machine. If you want to use Log Monitoring feature, you will have to install Linux Log Monitoring management pack, shipped in box. This change is introduced so omsagent user is created only when you are using Log file monitoring feature.

## Agent Initiated Maintenance Mode Improvement
Agent initiated maintenance mode is a crucial feature to suspend monitoring when the monitored object is taken offline for maintenance. With SCOM 2019, this feature will be event-based as opposed to registry-based, earlier. This new change will trigger agent-initiated maintenance mode through an event. As events are almost real time, management server immediately reads the maintenance mode event from agent machine and would never miss processing the maintenance request.

With the registry-based approach, there was a probability that management server might not be able to read the agent registry before agent turns-off. In such cases false alerts are generated.

>[!NOTE]

>You can turn off your machine right after running this command. An event will notify management server to suspend monitoring on this machine.

## Enabling Scheduled Maintenance Mode with SQL Always-On
The Scheduled Maintenance Mode feature was shipped in Operations Manager 2016 RTM. It was discovered later that in case of Operations Manager deployments that had SQL **Always ON** enabled for high-availability, the Schedule Maintenance Mode capability does not work as expected when the SQL Server failover occurs.

Schedules that were created by having SQL **Always ON** enabled were inaccessible when SQL server fails over to another server.

2019 comes with a fix for this problem.

The fix for this problem enables the schedules to work without any issues even in a SQL Server failover scenario.

This problem has been resolved in the following manner:

* Schedules that were created before this fix is deployed will also start working without any issues even in SQL Server failover scenarios.
>[!NOTE]
>Existing schedules that have been created on the current server that is running SQL Server will be migrated. To migrate the existing schedules that are created on another server, follow the installation instructions.

* Any schedule that is created after you deploy this update together with the required configurations would be accessible even if the server that is running SQL Server fails over to a different server.

## New Alert experience
The existing alert closure experience for the alerts generated by monitors has been revamped to be more meaningful and provide better value.

When you receive an alert, you can see in the alert details such as - whether the alert was generated by a rule or a monitor. If the alert was generated by a monitor, as a best practice, you should allow the monitor to auto-resolve the alert when the health state returns to healthy.

In the earlier versions of SCOM, if you close the alert while the object is in a warning, critical or unhealthy state, the problem remains unresolved, and no further alerts are generated, unless the health state for the monitor has also been reset, which again is a manual task.

This behavior, which often led to closure of critical alerts without resolving the underlying problem is fixed with SCOM 2019. An alert which has been generated by a monitor cannot be closed unless the health state of the corresponding monitor is healthy.

* SQL Server 2017 and Service Packs as detailed [here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/search?alpha=SQL%20server%202017%20)
*	SQL Server 2016 and Service Packs as detailed [here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/search?alpha=SQL%20server%202016%20)
For more information about  SQL Server Design Considerations, see  SCOM 2016 [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/system-center/scom/plan-sqlserver-design?view=sc-om-2016).

## In-place upgrade
System Center 2019 - Operations Manager supports an in-place upgrade from the following versions:

* System Center 2019 Technical Preview X - Operations Manager
* System Center 2016 Operations Manager
*	System Center 1801 Operations Manager
*	System Center 1807 Operations Manager

## Notifications and subscriptions enhancement  
The existing alert notifications and subscription experience in SCOM has been enhanced to deliver more value to the end user. These enhancements can be broadly categorized into the following two areas: **Intuitive Email Notifications** and **Enhanced Criteria Builder**.

## URL monitoring enhancements with certificate errors
URL monitoring (and web application availability & transaction monitoring), are used to test a URL\website\web-based application, by sending WinHttp requests, validating their response, and measuring their performance.  

## Configure APM component during agent install or repair
In System Center Operations Manager version 2019 agent, the Application Performance Monitoring (APM) feature could cause a crash with IIS Application pools and could crash the SharePoint Central Administration v4 application pool running .NET Framework 2.0, preventing it from starting. You can now disable the APM component when you deploy the Operations Manager agent from Discovery Wizard in the console, when performing a repair of the agent from the Operations console, and similarly controlling behavior when using the PowerShell cmdlets **Install-SCOMAgent** and **Repair-SCOMAgent**. [Learn more](../scom/manage-deploy-windows-agent-manually.md).

## Linux log rotation
To prevent the SCX logs from growing and consuming all available free space on the system disk, a log rotation feature is now available for the SCX agent. [Learn more](../scom/manage-monitoring-unix-linux.md).

## HTML5 Web console enhancements
The following improvements are provided in the Web console for version 2019:

* Added the PowerShell widget
* Includes an effective configuration widget in the Monitoring objects detail page showing the running rules and monitors and override settings applied
* Network node/network interface drill-down is now available as a tab when you select a network device and drill-down to the Monitoring objects detailed page. It delivers the same experience as what is available in the Operations console.
* Alert widget enhancement includes an improved layout and presentation of alert details. You can modify the resolution state and drill down to the Monitoring object details page for the alert source.
* The monitoring tree can be hidden when a dashboard is integrated with SharePoint.
* The size of the health icon can be changed in the Topology widget.
* Managing maintenance schedules can be accomplished in the Web console matching the experience in the Operations console.
* User and operators can create dashboards in My Workspace. [Learn more](../scom/manage-overview-html5-webconsole.md).

## Support for SQL Server 2017
With version 2019, upgrading from SQL Server 2016 to SQL Server 2017 is supported.

## Operations Manager and Service Manager console coexistence
The Operations and Service Manager version 2019 consoles, as well as PowerShell modules can be installed on the same system. [Learn more](https://support.microsoft.com/en-in/help/4093685/update-rollup-5-for-system-center-2016-service-manager).

## OpenSSL 1.1.0 version support
On Linux platforms, OpenSSL 0.9.8 support is dropped and we have added support for OpenSSL 1.1.0.

## Ubuntu 18 and Debian 9 support
These Linux platforms are added to our support matrix for monitoring UNIX and Linux computers.

## Auto detection of Pseudo FS and drop Enumeration
The UNIX and Linux agent has been enhanced to detect pseudo file system dynamically and ignore enumeration.  

## Enter product key from the Operations console

In previous versions of Operations Manager, you had to upgrade from the evaluation version to a licensed version using the PowerShell cmdlet **Set-SCOMLicense** after initial deployment of a new management group.  Registering the product key can now be performed during or after setup in the Operations console. The PowerShell cmdlet **Set-SCOMLicense** has been updated to support registering the license key remotely from a management server.

## Linux monitoring
You can now use a Linux agent with FluentD support for log file monitoring at par with Windows Server. This update provides the following improvements over previous log file monitoring:

- Wild-card characters in log file name and path.
- New match patterns for customizable log search like simple match, exclusive match, correlated match, repeated correlation, and exclusive correlation.
- Support for generic Fluentd plugins published by the fluentd community.

## Improved HTML5 dashboarding experience
The Web console has been redesigned and is now a fully HTML-based console and no longer has a dependency on Silverlight. The new dashboards have been redesigned with:  

* Modern user interface
* Simplified widget and dashboard authoring
* Accessible from multiple browsers
* Enhanced troubleshooting experience with drill-down pages
* Extensibility with a custom widget using a new [REST API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/operationsmanager)
* Export and share dashboards

Network authentication is enabled with the new web console. [Learn more](../scom/manage-overview-html5-webconsole.md).

## System Center Visual Studio Authoring Extension (VSAE) support for Visual Studio 2017
Visual Studio Authoring Extension (VSAE) is now updated to be compatible with Visual Studio(VS) 2017. Management Pack (MP) developers can continue using it with the latest version of Visual Studio to create custom management packs and use one of the MP templates provided, or edit an existing MP.   

## Enhanced SDK Client performance
We have introduced performance improvements in the Operations console that typically prevent the console from responding while a new management pack is being imported or deleted, or a configuration change to an MP is saved.  

## Updates and recommendations for third-party Management Packs

In System Center 2016, we released the MP Updates and Recommendations feature, which has been extended to include discovery and downloads of third-party management pack updates, based on feedback from customers.

## Linux Kerberos support
Operations Manager can now support Kerberos authentication wherever the WS-Management protocol is used by the management server to communicate with UNIX and Linux computers, providing greater security by no longer needing to enable basic authentication for Windows Remote Management (WinRM).

## Service Map integration
Service Map automatically discovers application components on Windows and Linux systems and maps the communication between services. It automatically builds a common reference map of dependencies across your servers, processes, and third-party services. Integration between Service Map and System Center Operations Manager allows you to automatically create distributed application diagrams in Operations Manager that are based on the dynamic dependency maps in Service Map.  For more information on planning and configuring  integration, see [Service Map integration with System Center Operations Manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/operations-management-suite/operations-management-suite-service-map-scom).
