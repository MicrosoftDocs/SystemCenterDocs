## New features in Operations Manager 2019

See the following sections for detailed information about the new and updated features in Operations Manager 2019.

### Service log on is enabled by default in Operations Manager 2019
Operations Manager 2019 supports hardening of service accounts and does not require Interactive and Remote Interactive Log On rights for service accounts.

Operations Manager 2019 uses *Service Log on* as the logon type, by default. [Learn more](../scom/enable-service-logon.md).

### Improved experience for HTML5 dashboard
The Web console has been redesigned and is now a fully functional HTML-based console, and no longer has a dependency on Silverlight. The new dashboards have been redesigned with:  

* Modern user interface
* Simplified widget and dashboard authoring
* Accessible from multiple browsers
* Enhanced troubleshooting experience with drill-down pages
* Extensibility with a custom widget using a new [REST API](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/operationsmanager)
* Capability to export and share dashboards
* New *All* option to select all objects while creating/editing Alerts widget.

Network authentication is enabled with the enhanced web console. [Learn more](../scom/manage-overview-html5-webconsole.md).

### Enhanced experience for alerts raised by monitors
The alert closure experience for the alerts generated by a monitor has been revamped to be more meaningful and impactful to your service availability goals.

When you view an alert's detail in alerts view, you can see whether the alert was generated by a rule or a monitor. If the alert was generated by a monitor, as a best practice, you should allow the monitor to auto resolve the alert when the health state returns to healthy.

In earlier versions of Operations Manager, if you closed the alert while the object is in a warning, critical or unhealthy state, the problem remains unresolved, and no further alerts are generated unless the health state for the monitor has also been reset, which again is a manual task.

This behavior, which often led to closure of critical alerts without resolving the underlying problem, is fixed with Operations Manager 2019. An alert generated by a monitor cannot be closed unless the health state of the corresponding monitor is healthy.

### Notifications and subscriptions enhancement  
The existing alert notifications and subscription experience in Operations Manager has been enhanced to deliver more value to the end user. These enhancements can be broadly categorized into the following two areas:

- **Intuitive Email notifications** - Operations Manager 2019 supports email notifications in HTML format. [Learn more](../scom/manage-notifications-create-email-channel.md#create-an-email-notification-in-html-format).

- **Enhanced Criteria Builder** - You may now use the regular expressions to build a complex yet useful subscription criteria. [Learn more](../scom/manage-notifications-create-subscriptions.md).

### Management server failover support for Linux and UNIX monitoring
Failover of the management server in a resource pool supporting monitoring of a workload ensures high availability and fault tolerance. In earlier versions of Operations Manager, when a primary management server fails and another management server takes over the role of the primary management server in the pool, the existing monitor-based alerts in Operations Manager are closed and new alerts are created for the same condition. In deployments where the Operations Manager is integrated with an incident management system, these new alerts lead to new tickets or incidents being created.

This issue of alerts/tickets being created during failover or load balancing of management server has been addressed in Operations Manager 2019. With this fix, when the primary management server fails over, the alerts do not get recreated. Only the repeat count of the existing alerts is incremented.

### Linux agent installation changes
With Operations Manager 2019, there are changes in the Linux agent package bundling. This bundle now consists of **scx** and **omi** shell bundles only. Post agent installation, a new user called **omi** will be created on the agent computer. If you want to use the Log Monitoring feature, you must install Linux Log Monitoring management pack, provided in Operations Manager 2019.

This change is introduced to ensure *omsagent* user is created only when you use the Log File Monitoring feature. [Learn more](../scom/manage-install-crossplat-agent-cmdline.md).

To use the Log Monitoring feature, you must install the Linux Log Monitoring management pack, included in Operations Manager 2019. [Learn More](../scom/manage-linux-logfiles.md).

### Improvement in agent initiated maintenance mode
Agent initiated maintenance mode is a crucial feature to suspend monitoring when the monitored object is taken offline for maintenance. With Operations Manager 2019, maintenance mode is triggered based on an event, as opposed to being registry-based as used  in earlier releases. With the registry-based approach, there was a probability that  a management server might not be able to read the agents registry before the agent computer is shutdown. In such cases, false alerts are generated.

With event-based agent-initiated maintenance mode, as events are almost real time, a management server immediately reads the maintenance mode event from the agent computer and would never miss processing the maintenance request.

>[!NOTE]
>You can turn off your computer right after running this command. An event will notify the management server to suspend monitoring on this computer.

### Ability to enable scheduled maintenance mode with SQL Always on
Scheduled maintenance mode has been a feature of Operations Manager since the 2016 release. In earlier releases, if Operations Manager deployments had SQL Always on enabled for high-availability, the schedules were inaccessible when the SQL Server failover occurs in the availability group.

Operations Manager 2019 introduces a fix for this issue to ensure scheduled maintenance mode capability works as expected, even when SQL Server failover occurs.

### Microsoft Monitoring Agent operating system

*  System Center 1807 Operations Manager

### URL monitoring enhancements for server certificate errors
The existing URL monitoring capability has been enhanced. With this improvement, Operations Manager will not ignore the server certificate errors (like server certificate CN, expiry date, untrusted CA, and wrong usage) by default. If you wish to monitor websites that do not have a valid SSL certificate, select *Ignore Server Certificate Errors* checkbox in your Web application *Properties*. [Learn more](../scom/web-application-properties.md).

### Updates and Recommendation feature for Linux
**Updates and Recommendations** feature, which was available for Windows workloads, is now extended for Linux workloads. This feature helps you to proactively identify workloads, deployed on your Linux computers that were not monitored by Operations Manager or are not monitored using the latest version of Management Pack (MP). [Learn more](../scom/manage-mp-mpassessment.md).

If there are MPs in the catalog that are designed to monitor those workloads, they will be displayed on the **Updates and Recommendations** page. You will also find a list of any updates that are available for the management packs that are installed in your management group.

A new capability, **Machine Details** allow administrators to view the agent computer's name and the operating system installed on it.    

### Support for latest Application Servers
Operations Manager 2019 supports latest Application Servers. [Learn more](../scom/manage-mp-mpassessment.md#supported-application-servers).

### Support for client-side monitoring on multiple browsers
With Operations Manager 2019, client-sider-monitoring supports the following web browsers in addition to Internet Explorer:
-	Microsoft Edge (version 42 or higher)
-	Google Chrome (version 68 or higher)

### Enhanced support for Application Performance Monitoring
Application Performance Monitoring can now monitor websites that are created with SharePoint 2016.

> [!NOTE]
> The following features/feature updates were introduced in Operations Manager 1807, included in 2019.

### Configure APM component during agent install or repair
You can now disable the APM component when you deploy the Operations Manager agent from **Discovery** wizard in the console, when performing a repair of the agent from the Operations console, and similarly controlling behavior when using the PowerShell cmdlets **Install-SCOMAgent** and **Repair-SCOMAgent**. [Learn more](../scom/manage-deploy-windows-agent-manually.md).

### Linux log rotation
To prevent the SCX logs from growing and consuming all available free space on the system disk, a log rotation feature is now available for the SCX agent. [Learn more](../scom/manage-monitoring-unix-linux.md).

### Operations Manager and Service Manager console coexistence
The Operations and Service Manager consoles, as well as PowerShell modules can be installed on the same system.

### OpenSSL 1.1.0 version support
On Linux platforms, OpenSSL 0.9.8 support is dropped, and added support for OpenSSL 1.1.0 to support TLS 1.2.

### Auto detection of Pseudo FS and drop Enumeration
The UNIX and Linux agents have been enhanced to detect pseudo file system dynamically and ignore enumeration.

> [!NOTE]
> The following features/feature updates were introduced in Operations Manager 1801, included in 2019..

### Linux monitoring
You can now use a Linux agent with FluentD support for log file monitoring at par with Windows Server. This update provides the following improvements over previous log file monitoring:

- Wild-card characters in log file name and path.
- New match patterns for customizable log search like simple match, exclusive match, correlated match, repeated  correlation, and exclusive correlation.
- Support for generic Fluentd plugins published by the fluentd community. [Learn more](../scom/manage-linux-logfiles.md).

### System Center Visual Studio Authoring Extension (VSAE) support for Visual Studio 2017
Visual Studio Authoring Extension (VSAE) is now updated to be compatible with Visual Studio(VS) 2017. Management Pack (MP) developers can continue using it with the latest version of Visual Studio to create custom management packs and use one of the MP templates provided, or edit an existing MP.

### Enhanced SDK client performance
We have introduced performance improvements in the Operations console that typically prevent the console from responding while a new management pack is being imported or deleted, or a configuration change to an MP is saved.  

### Linux Kerberos support
Operations Manager can now support Kerberos authentication wherever the WS-Management protocol is used by the management server to communicate with UNIX and Linux computers, providing greater security by no longer needing to enable basic authentication for Windows Remote Management (WinRM).

### Service Map integration
Service Map automatically discovers application components on Windows and Linux systems and maps the communication between services. It automatically builds a common reference map of dependencies across your servers, processes, and third-party services. Integration between Service Map and System Center Operations Manager allows you to automatically create distributed application diagrams in Operations Manager that are based on the dynamic dependency maps in Service Map.  For more information on planning and configuring  integration, see [Service Map integration with System Center Operations Manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/operations-management-suite/operations-management-suite-service-map-scom).  

### Support for product key from the Operations console
In previous versions of Operations Manager, you had to upgrade from the evaluation version to a licensed version using the PowerShell cmdlet **Set-SCOMLicense** after initial deployment of a new management group. Registration of the product key can now be done during or after setup in the Operations console. The PowerShell cmdlet **Set-SCOMLicense** has been updated to support registering the license key remotely from a management server.

## New features in Operations Manager 2019 UR1
See the following sections for information about the new features/feature updates supported in operations Manager 2019 UR1.

### Multi-language installer for Operation Manager components

The following components now have a single installer each for all supported languages, instead of language specific installers. The installer automatically selects the language based on the computer's language settings, where you are installing.

- Console
- ACS
- Web Console
- Reporting

### Simplified management server patching
Operations Manager 2019 UR1 introduces a frictionless way of patching the Operations Manager server.

The improvised user interface guides you through the installation steps, which patch the management server, update the databases and update the management packs. See this article for more information on how integrated patching is done.

### Distro-Agnostic management pack for Linux

The existing universal management packs are enhanced in Operations Manager 2019 UR1. Any new Linux platform support will be made available via these management packs based on the kind of distribution, RPM or DEB. These management packs will also be version and distribution agnostic, which means, for all future Linux platforms support, the same management pack will be updated instead of releasing a new management pack per Linux distribution.

The existing management packs for RHEL-7 and SLES-12 will continue to work. The universal management packs will support discovering and monitoring RHEL-8 and SLES-15, and any new platforms that we intend to support in the future.

The existing SLES-15 MP has been removed from the download center and you are advised to use the new universal management pack for its discovery and monitoring. Download the updated management packs from [here](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=58208) and follow these steps to discover and monitor RHEL 8 and SLES 15:

1.	Install Operations Manager 2019 UR1 Server and Console patch.
2.	Import the following management packs from Microsoft System Center 2019 management pack for Unix and Linux Preview.msi:
	- Microsoft.Unix.Library.mp
    - Microsoft.Linux.Library.mp
    -Microsoft.Linux.Universal.Library.mp
    - Microsoft.Linux.Universal.Monitoring.mp
    - Microsoft.Linux.UniversalR.1.mpb (Discover/Monitor RPM distros)
    - Microsoft.Linux.UniversalD.1.mpb (Discover/Monitor Debian distros)
3.	Run the Discovery Wizard in Console.


### Support for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8  
Operations Manager 2019 UR1 supports Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8. Use the universal management pack (detailed above) to discover and monitor RHEL-8.

### Performance and reliability improvement in Linux
With Operations Manager 2019 UR1, to improve the reliability, a separate process is introduced to send the heartbeat. Earlier, the performance and heartbeat collection threads used to run under the same process context. Due to this, any delay in performance data collection was affecting the system availability.

With this change in 2019 UR1, during heartbeat collection, you can now see an additional *omiagent* process running under *omi* user. [Learn more](../scom/manage-security-administer-crossplat-agent.md#performance-and-reliability-improvements-in-the-linux-agent).

### Updates to management packs
Operations Manager 2019 UR1 includes updates to the following management packs:

- [Azure management pack](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=58013)
- [Storage spaces direct management pack](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=100782)

### Support for group Managed Service Accounts
Operations Manager 2019 UR1 supports group Managed Service Accounts (gMSA). [Learn more](../scom/support-group-managed-service-accounts.md).

### Scalability improvement with Unix/Linux agent monitoring
Operations Manager 2019 UR1 includes improved scalability in Unix/Linux agents that can be monitored per management server. The following changes will take effect to take advantage of this improvement:

-	Use of Async Windows Management Infrastructure (MI) APIs is a default functionality from Operations Manager 2019 UR1. A registry key *UseMIAPI* will be created (if not existing) and a new registry value *Disable* will be added to **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Microsoft Operations Manager\3.0\Setup\UseMIAPI**.
-	As part of Operations Manager 2019 UR1 installation, value of registry key **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Microsoft Operations Manager\3.0\Setup\UseMIAPI\Disable** will be set as **0**.
-	To use *Sync WSMan APIs*, you need to set the value of registry key **HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Microsoft Operations Manager\3.0\Setup\UseMIAPI\Disable** as **1**. For any other scenario, Async MI API will be used.
