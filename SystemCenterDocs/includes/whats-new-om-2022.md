## New features in Operations Manager 2022

The following sections introduce new and updated features in System Center Operations Manager 2022 - Operations Manager.

### Enhanced Operations Manager RBAC

With Operations Manager 2022, new build-in roles are created for enhanced user experience.  

- A new built-in role **Read-only Administrator** is supported. This role provides all the read permissions in Operations Manager including reporting.
- You can create custom user roles with specific permissions. The **Agent Management** now supports two new subcategories - **Deploy Agents** and **Repair Agents**, that implicitly provide permission to **Agent Pending Actions**.
- A new **Delegated Administrator** profile has been introduced, which is Read-Only Administrator except reporting. You can create a custom user role with **Delegated Administrator** as the base profile and add one or more permissions to it from the available categories.
