## What's new in SMA 2022

The following sections provide information about the new feature(s)/enhancements updates supported in SMA 2022.

### Improved reliability of SMA jobs

With improvements made in Sandbox lifecycle management, we've improved the overall reliability of jobs run in SMA. See [release notes](/system-center/sma/release-notes-sma?view=sc-sma-2022&preserve-view=true) for details of the improvements done.

### Support for PowerShell filters

With SMA 2022, [PowerShell filters](/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_functions?view=powershell-5.1&preserve-view=true#filters) are supported in PowerShell script and workflow Runbooks. Earlier, PowerShell filters worked only when imported from PowerShell modules (`.psm1`).
