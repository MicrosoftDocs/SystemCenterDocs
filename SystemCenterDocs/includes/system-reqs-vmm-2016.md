## VMM 2016 system requirements

The following sections describe the scalability information, hardware, software, and SQL Server requirements for VMM 2016, and summarizes the support for the servers managed in the VMM fabric.

## Capacity limits

The following table provides the scale limits that were tested for System Center 2016 Virtual Machine Manager. There are various factors that impact the scale limits, such as hardware configuration, network, topology and others.

The [planning guide](https://technet.microsoft.com/system-center-docs/vmm/plan/plan-overview) provides the details about how these factors can be adapted to specific requirements.
