<Token xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">Microsoft supports a failover cluster solution only if all the hardware components are marked as "Certified for Windows ServerÂ 2008." In addition, the complete configuration (servers, network, and storage) must pass all tests in the Validate a Configuration wizard, which is included in the Failover Cluster Management snap-in.</Token>
