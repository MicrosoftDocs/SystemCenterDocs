## What's new in System Center 2019 - Service Manager
The following sections summarize the new features released in SM 2019.

## Support to enhanced evaluation experience
SM 2019 supports an enhanced experience for evaluating Service Manager and activating the product for retail use.  

The evaluation version of Service Manager can be installed and used for 180 days. In SM 2016, after an evaluation version is installed, there was no option to view the remaining days for the evaluation period. In Service Manager 2019, you can view the information about the evaluation period, and accordingly activate your SM. [Learn more](../scsm/sm-license.md)

## Support to SQL 2017
SM 2019 supports SQL Server 2017 fresh installation.

## Support to TLS
To ensure secure communication, SM 2019 supports Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.2. For information about how to set up, configure and run your environment to use TLS 1.2, [Read this article](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4051111/tls-1-2-protocol-support-deployment-guide-for-system-center-2016).

##	Active Directory Connector Improvement
The Active Directory (AD) connector has been improvised to synchronize with a specific domain controller. You may specify the Domain Controller in the LDAP query of the Active Directory connector.

##	Improved UI Responsiveness
The user interface has been made more responsive by addressing memory leak problems.
