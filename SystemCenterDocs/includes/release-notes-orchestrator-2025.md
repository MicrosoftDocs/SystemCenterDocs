## Orchestrator 2025 release notes

The following sections summarize the release notes for Orchestrator 2025, and include all issues fixed until Orchestrator 2022 UR2.

Additionally, the following issues are fixed:

- Send platform event activity is persisted to the database and is visible in **Events** tab of the Runbook Designer.
- Latest `plink.exe` is shipped with this release. Manual update of `pllink.exe` in Run SSH activity isn't required.  
- Query database activity error *Failed to load extension* is fixed.
- Orchestrator keys can be recreated.
- Activities persist custom separators while you configure Run behavior for the activity.
- GET api/ActivityInstances returns the expected value.
- Activity names are correctly displayed on the Runbook Tester canvas and log view area instead of identifiers.

The following sections summarize the known issues and workarounds in System Center Orchestrator 2025:

### Runbooks that aren't inside any folder (root runbooks) aren't shown on the navigation pane

**Workaround**: Move root runbooks to a folder.

### Job form requires output parameter also

**Workaround**: Use any string as value, it will be overwritten by the runbook execution with the output.

### Orchestrator Remoting Service and Runbook Server Monitor Service donâ€™t exit cleanly

**Description**: The *oremoting and omonitor* services can't be stopped using Service kill.

**Workaround**: Kill the service process manually using Task Manager or by using the following command:

```cmd
taskkill /f /pid {pid of the service} 
```
