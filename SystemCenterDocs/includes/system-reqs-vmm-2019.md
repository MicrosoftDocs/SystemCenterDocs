## VMM 2019 system requirements

The following sections describe the scalability information, hardware, software, and SQL Server requirements for VMM 2019, and summarize the support for the servers managed in the VMM fabric.

## Capacity limits

The following table provides the scale limits that were tested for System Center  Virtual Machine Manager 2019. There are various factors that impact the scale limits, such as hardware configuration, network, topology, and others.

The [planning guide](../vmm/plan-install.md) provides the details about how these factors can be adapted to specific requirements.

--- | ---
Physical hosts | 1000
Virtual Machines | 25000
Services | 1000
User roles | 1000
Clouds | 20
Virtual networks| 2000
logical networks| 20
Library resources| 1000
Library Objects (templates, profiles)| 100
