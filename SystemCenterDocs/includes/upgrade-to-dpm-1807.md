## Update to DPM 1807

You can update System Center Data Protection Manager (DPM) version 1807 only from DPM 1801. DPM 1807 is the second release in the System Center Semi-Annual Channel (SAC). If you want to update to DPM 1807 from DPM 2016, you must first install DPM 1801 using the steps in the article [Upgrade your DPM installation](../dpm/upgrade-dpm.md).


## Update steps for DPM 1807

1. To install DPM, double-click Setup.exe to open the System Center 1807 wizard.
2. Under Install, select Data Protection Manager to start the setup wizard. Agree to the license terms and conditions and follow the setup wizard.
