## System requirements for System Center 2016 - Service Manager

The following sections describe the general performance and scalability guidance for SM 2016, and recommend the  hardware configurations for a variety of workloads. Because System Center 2016 is built to be flexible and scalable, the hardware requirements for specific scenarios may differ from the guidelines that are presented here.  

## Capacity limits for Service Manager

[Learn about](../scsm/deploy-topo-scenarios.md) the tested capacity limits for various Service Manager deployment scenarios.

## Supported coexistence

To help simplify upgrades, you can use the following Service Manager 2016 connectors with System Center 2012 R2 components.

- System Center 2012 R2 Virtual Machine manager
- System Center 2012 R2 Orchestrator
- System Center 2012 R2 Operations Manager
- System Center 2012 R2 Configuration Manager
- System Center Configuration Manager (SCCM) CB releases - 1511, 1602, 1606 and 1710.
    - UR5 supports 1802
    - UR9 supports 1806, 1810, 1902, 1906, 1910, and 2002 releases. However, there is a limitation that the size of the devices supported by SCCM should be less than 2 PB.
    - UR10 supports 2006
    - 2010 (supported with Service Manager 2016 UR10)

| **Service Manager/data warehouse databases** |      The Service Manager or data warehouse databases require:  SQL Server Reporting Services \(SSRS\); SQL Server Analysis Management Objects.<br/><br/> The SQL Server and Analysis Services collation settings must be the same for the computers hosting the Service Manager database, data warehouse database, analysis services database, and Reporting Services database.      |
|         **Service Manager console**          | The console requires: Microsoft Report Viewer Redistributable (available on System Center media): Microsoft Excel in order view OLAP data cubes on the console computer;  ADO.NET Data Services Update for .NET Framework 3.5 SP1 for Windows Server; SQL Server Analysis Management Objects<br/><br/> The console can be installed on both 32\-bit and 64\-bit editions of Windows. |

|      **SQL Server Reporting Services**       |                                         In a deployment topology where the computer hosting SSRS is not on the same computer that hosts the data warehouse management server, you have to add **Microsoft.EnterpriseManagement.Reporting.Code** to the global assembly cache. [Learn about](../scsm/config-remote-ssrs.md) the manual steps.                                         |

[Read about](../scsm/om-considerations.md) installing both Service Manager and Operations Manager in the same environment.<br/><br/> You can create a data mart for Operations Manager.                                      |
|          **Configuration Manager**           |                                                                                                                                       Service Manager can import configuration items from a Configuration Manager environment.                                                                                                                                       |
|           **Network requirements**           |                                                                                                    To view external content from within knowledge articles, computers that host the Service Manager console must have Internet access, either directly or through a proxy server.                                                                                                    |

|            **Windows safe mode**             |                                              Service Manager doesn't operate and the services used by Service Manager do not start if Windows Server is running in safe mode. If you attempt to start the Service Manager services manually while in safe mode, the services fail to start and an error is written into the event log.                                               |

Microsoft SQL Server hosts the databases that System Center 2016 - Service Manager creates. In addition, System Center 2016 - Service Manager requires SQL Server Analysis Services (SSAS) to work with Microsoft Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) cubes. SQL Server Reporting Services (SSRS) is required to support System Center 2016 - Service Manager reporting.

Use this information to evaluate if your SQL Server environment is ready to support the installation of or upgrade to System Center 2016. Use this information whether you are deploying one or multiple components of System Center.

## SQL Server versions

The following table summarizes the support for SQL Server 64-bit Enterprise and Standard versions.

> [!NOTE]
> For the supported versions of SQL, use the service packs that are currently in support by Microsoft.


**Service Manager** | **SQL Server 2012** | **SQL Server 2014 and [SPs](https://docs.microsoft.com/lifecycle/products/?terms=SQL%20Server%202014)**  | **SQL Server 2016 and [SPs](https://docs.microsoft.com/lifecycle/products/?terms=SQL%20Server%202016)**

**Service Manager/Data Warehouse database** | | &#8226;| &#8226;



- System Center 2016 - Service Manager doesn't support setting the MultiSubnetFailover parameter. This parameter is not used in Service Manager connection strings.
- SQL Server AlwaysOn Availability Groups are supported in System Center 2016 - Service Manager. [Learn more](../scsm/sql-always-on.md).
- To install or upgrade Service Manager, SQL Server machines that host databases must be configured to allow updates. Otherwise an error appears when Service Manager tries to create a database:
    - *An error occurred while executing a customer action: _ExecuteSqlScripts. This upgrade attempt has failed before permanent modifications were made. Upgrade has successfully rolled back to the original state of the system. Once the corrections are made, you can retry upgrade for this role.*
    - You can check the status of **allow updates** on SQL Server by executing the following stored procedure from within SQL Server Management Studio:
        ```
        sp_configure 'allow updates'
        ```
        In the results table, examine the value for "run_value". If the value of "run value" is 1, set it back to 0 with the following stored procedure, and then run Setup again.

        ```
        sp_configure 'allow updates',0 reconfigure with override
        ```
