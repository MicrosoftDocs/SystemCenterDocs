<Token xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">To run nlb.exe from a remote computer, you must enable remote control on the host that is running Network Load Balancing. The Network Load Balancing remote control option presents many security risks, including the possibility of data tampering, denial of service and information disclosure. Only use remote control on a secure computer within your firewall. Because of the many security risks remote control presents, it is recommended that you do not enable the remote control feature. Instead, use other remote management tools such as Network Load Balancing Manager or Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI).</Token>
