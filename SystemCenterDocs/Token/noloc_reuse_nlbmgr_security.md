<Token xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">When using Network Load Balancing Manager, you must be a member of the Administrators group on the host that you are configuring, or you must have been delegated the appropriate authority. As a security best practice, consider using Run as to perform this procedure. If you are configuring a cluster or host by running Network Load Balancing Manager from a computer that is not part of the cluster, you do not need to be a member of the Administrators group on that computer.
