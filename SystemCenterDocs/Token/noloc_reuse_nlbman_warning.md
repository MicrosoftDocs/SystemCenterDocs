<Token xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">If you are working from a computer that has a single network adapter that is bound to Network Load Balancing in unicast mode, you cannot use Network Load Balancing Manager on this computer to configure and manage other hosts because a single network adapter in unicast mode cannot have intrahost communication. You can, however, communicate with computers outside of the cluster.</Token>
