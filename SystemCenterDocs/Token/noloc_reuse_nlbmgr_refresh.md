<Token xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">To ensure that Network Load Balancing Manager is displaying the most recent host information, right-click the cluster and click <legacyBold xmlns="http://ddue.schemas.microsoft.com/authoring/2003/5">Refresh</legacyBold>. This step is necessary because the host properties that Network Load Balancing Manager displays are a copy of the host properties that were configured the last time Network Load Balancing Manager connected to that host. When you click <legacyBold xmlns="http://ddue.schemas.microsoft.com/authoring/2003/5">Refresh</legacyBold>, Network Load Balancing Manager reconnects to the cluster and displays updated information.</Token>
