# How to Search for a Knowledge Article
You can use the following procedures to search for a knowledge article by using the [!INCLUDE[smcons](./Token/smcons_md.md)] in [!INCLUDE[smlong12](./Token/smlong12_md.md)]. If you want to link a knowledge article to an incident or to a change request, save the incident or change request first. You can perform full\-text searches when you search for knowledge articles. When you search, [!INCLUDE[smshort](./Token/smshort_md.md)] queries the following fields in the knowledge search form:

-   **Title**

-   **Description**

-   **Comments**

-   **Keywords**

-   **External URL**

-   **Internal Content**

-   **Analyst Content**

When the search is complete, [!INCLUDE[smshort](./Token/smshort_md.md)] displays matches for content in the **Title**, **End\-User** content, and **Analyst Content** fields. If you want to view the whole article, click **Open article to see external content**. If you type **Vista** in the search box, that exact string must exist in one of the knowledge article fields.

> [!NOTE]
> Partial matches are not returned by a search. Therefore, when you search for a knowledge article based on a keyword, you must type the exact word. However, you can use the asterisk \(\*\) as a wildcard character when you perform a search.
