# Cross-Forest Domain Trusts in VMM
In your environment you might have user accounts in one forest and your VMM servers and host in another. In this environment, you must establish a two\-way trust between the two cross\-forest domains. One\-way trusts between cross\-forest domains are not supported in [!INCLUDE[vmm12short](../Token/vmm12short_md.md)].
