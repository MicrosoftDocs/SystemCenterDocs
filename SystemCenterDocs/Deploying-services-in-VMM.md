# Deploying services in VMM
A service in [!INCLUDE[vmm12sp1_long](Token/vmm12sp1_long_md.md)] can be deployed to a private cloud or to a host group. Before you can deploy a service, you must create a service template. For more information about creating service templates, see [Creating service templates in VMM](Creating-service-templates-in-VMM.md).
